<h3><i>THE BEGINNINGS OF ARIANISM</i>.</h3>


<p>Arianism is extinct only in the sense that it has long
ceased to furnish party names. It sprang from permanent
tendencies of human nature, and raised questions
whose interest can never perish. As long as the
Agnostic and the Evolutionist are with us, the old
battlefields of Athanasius will not be left to silence.
Moreover, no writer more directly joins the new world
of Teutonic Christianity with the old of Greek and
Roman heathenism. Arianism began its career partly
as a theory of Christianity, partly as an Eastern
reaction of philosophy against a gospel of the Son of
God. Through sixty years of ups and downs and
stormy controversy it fought, and not without success,
for the dominion of the world. When it was at last
rejected by the Empire, it fell back upon its converts
among the Northern nations, and renewed the contest
as a Western reaction of Teutonic pride against a
Roman gospel. The struggle went on for full three
hundred years in all, and on a scale of vastness never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
seen again in history. Even the Reformation was
limited to the West, whereas Arianism ranged at one
time or another through the whole of Christendom.
Nor was the battle merely for the wording of antiquated
creeds or for the outworks of the faith, but
for the very life of revelation. If the Reformation
decided the supremacy of revelation over church
authority, it was the contest with Arianism which
cleared the way, by settling for ages the deeper and
still more momentous question, which is once more
coming to the surface as the gravest doubt of our
time, whether a revelation is possible at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine
of the Lord's
person.</div>

<p>Unlike the founders of religions, Jesus of Nazareth
made his own person the centre of his message.
Through every act and utterance recorded
of him there runs a clear undoubting self-assertion,
utterly unknown to Moses or
Mahomet. He never spoke but with authority. His
first disciples told how he began his ministry by
altering the word which was said to them of old time,
and ended it by calmly claiming to be the future
Judge of all men. And they told the story of their own
life also; how they had seen his glory while he dwelt
among them, and how their risen Lord had sent them
forth to be his witnesses to all the nations. Whatever
might be doubtful, their personal knowledge of the
Lord was sure and certain, and of necessity became
the base and starting-point of their teaching. In
Christ all things were new. From him they learned
the meaning of their ancient scriptures; through him
they knew their heavenly Father; in him they saw
their Saviour from this present world, and to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
they looked for the crown of life in that to come.
His word was law, his love was life, and in his name
the world was overcome already. What mattered it
to analyse the power of life they felt within them?
It was enough to live and to rejoice; and their works
are one long hymn of triumphant hope and overflowing
thankfulness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In contact
(1) with the
vulgar.</div>

<p>It was easier for the first disciples to declare what
their own eyes had seen and their own hands had
handled of the Word of Life, than for
another generation to take up a record
which to themselves was only history, and
to pass from the traditional assertion of the Lord's
divinity to its deliberate enunciation in clear consciousness
of the difficulties which gathered round it when
the gospel came under the keen scrutiny of thoughtful
heathens. Whatever vice might be in heathenism,
there was no want of interest in religion. If the
doubts of some were real, the scoffs of many were
only surface-deep. If the old legends of Olympus
were outworn, philosophy was still a living faith, and
every sort of superstition flourished luxuriantly. Old
worships were revived, the ends of the earth were
searched for new ones. Isis or Mithras might help
where Jupiter was powerless, and uncouth lustrations
of the blood of bulls and goats might peradventure
cast a spell upon eternity. The age was too sad to
be an irreligious one. Thus from whatever quarter
a convert might approach the gospel, he brought
earlier ideas to bear upon its central question of the
person of the Lord. Who then was this man who
was dead, whom all the churches affirmed to be alive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and worshipped as the Son of God? If he was
divine, there must be two Gods; if not, his worship
was no better than the vulgar worships of the dead.
In either case, there seemed to be no escape from
the charge of polytheism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2) with the
philosophers.</div>

<p>The key of the difficulty is on its other side, in
the doctrine of the unity of God, which was not
only taught by Jews and Christians, but
generally admitted by serious heathens.
The philosophers spoke of a dim Supreme far off
from men, and even the polytheists were not unwilling
to subordinate their motley crew of gods to
some mysterious divinity beyond them all. So far
there was a general agreement. But underneath this
seeming harmony there was a deep divergence.
Resting on a firm basis of historic revelation,
Christianity could bear record of a God who loved
the world and of a Redeemer who had come in human
flesh. As this coming is enough to show that God
is something more than abstract perfection and infinity,
there is nothing incredible in a real incarnation,
or in a real trinity inside the unity of God.
But the heathen had no historic revelation of a living
hope to sustain him in that age of failure and
exhaustion. Nature was just as mighty, just as
ruthless then as now, and the gospel was not yet
the spring of hope it is in modern life. In our time
the very enemies of the cross are living in its light,
and drawing at their pleasure from the well of
Christian hope. It was not yet so in that age.
Brave men like Marcus Aurelius could only do their
duty with hopeless courage, and worship as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
might a God who seemed to refuse all answer to
the great and bitter cry of mankind. If he cares for
men, why does he let them perish? The less he
has to do with us, the better we can understand our
evil plight. Thus their Supreme was far beyond the
weakness of human sympathy. They made him less
a person than a thing or an idea, enveloped in clouds
of mysticism and abolished from the world by his
very exaltation over it. He must not touch it lest
it perish. The Redeemer whom the Christians worship
may be a hero or a prophet, an angel or a demi-god&mdash;anything
except a Son of God in human form.
We shall have to find some explanation for the scandal
of the incarnation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arius himself.</div>

<p>Arianism is Christianity shaped by thoughts like
these. Its author was no mere bustling schemer,
but a grave and blameless presbyter of
Alexandria. Arius was a disciple of the
greatest critic of his time, the venerated martyr Lucian
of Antioch. He had a name for learning, and his
letters bear witness to his dialectical skill and mastery
of subtle irony. At the outbreak of the controversy,
about the year 318, we find him in charge of the
church of Baucalis at Alexandria, and in high favour
with his bishop, Alexander. It was no love of
heathenism, but a real difficulty of the gospel which
led him to form a new theory. His aim was not to
lower the person of the Lord or to refuse him
worship, but to defend that worship from the charge
of polytheism. Starting from the Lord's humanity, he
was ready to add to it everything short of the fullest
deity. He could not get over the philosophical difficulty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
that one who is man cannot be also God, and
therefore a second God. Let us see how high a creature
can be raised without making hint essentially divine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His doctrine; Its merits.</div>

<p>The Arian Christ is indeed a lofty creature. He
claims our worship as the image of the Father, begotten
before all worlds, as the Son of God, by
whom all things were made, who for us
men took flesh and suffered and rose again, and sat
down at the right hand of the Father, and remains
both King and God for ever. Is not this a good confession?
What more can we want? Why should all
this glorious language go for nothing? God forbid
that it should go for nothing. Arianism
was at least so far Christian that it held
aloft the Lord's example as the Son of Man, and never
wavered in its worship of him as the Son of God.
Whatever be the errors of its creed, whatever the
scandals of its history, it was a power of life among
the Northern nations. Let us give Arianism full
honour for its noble work of missions in that age of
deep despair which saw the dissolution of the ancient
world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its real meaning.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, this plausible Arian confession will
not bear examination. It is only the philosophy
of the day put into a Christian dress. It
starts from the accepted belief that the
unity of God excludes not only distinctions inside the
divine nature, but also contact with the world. Thus
the God of Arius is an unknown God, whose being is
hidden in eternal mystery. No creature can reveal
him, and he cannot reveal himself. But if he is not
to touch the world, he needs a minister of creation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
The Lord is rather such a minister than the conqueror
of death and sin. No doubt he is the Son of God,
and begotten before all worlds. Scripture is quite
clear so far; but if he is distinct from the Father, he
is not God; and if he is a Son, he is not co-eternal
with the Father. And what is not God is creature,
and what is not eternal is also creature. On both
grounds, then, the Lord is only a creature; so that if
he is called God, it is in a lower and improper sense;
and if we speak of him as eternal, we mean no more
than the eternity of all things in God's counsel. Far
from sharing the essence of the Father, he does not
even understand his own. Nay, more; he is not even
a creature of the highest type. If he is not a sinner,
(Scripture forbids at least <i>that</i> theory, though some
Arians came very near it), his virtue is, like our own, a
constant struggle of free-will, not the fixed habit which
is the perfection and annulment of free-will. And now
that his human soul is useless, we may as well simplify
the incarnation into an assumption of human flesh
and nothing more. The Holy Spirit bears to the Son
a relation not unlike that of the Son to the Father.
Thus the Arian trinity of divine persons forms a
descending series, separated by infinite degrees of
honour and glory, resembling the philosophical triad
of orders of spiritual existence, extending outwards in
concentric circles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticism
of it.</div>

<p>Indeed the system is heathen to the core. The
Arian Christ is nothing but a heathen idol invented to
maintain a heathenish Supreme in heathen
isolation from the world. Never was a
more illogical theory devised by the wit of man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Arius proclaims a God of mystery, unfathomable to the
Son of God himself, and goes on to argue as if the divine
generation were no more mysterious than its human
type. He forgets first that metaphor would cease to
be metaphor if there were nothing beyond it; then
that it would cease to be true if its main idea were
misleading. He presses the metaphor of sonship as if
mere human relations could exhaust the meaning of
the divine; and soon works round to the conclusion
that it is no proper sonship at all. In his irreverent
hands the Lord's deity is but the common right of mankind,
his eternity no more than the beasts themselves
may claim. His clumsy logic overturns every doctrine
he is endeavouring to establish. He upholds the
Lord's divinity by making the Son of God a creature,
and then worships him to escape the reproach of
heathenism, although such worship, on his own showing,
is mere idolatry. He makes the Lord's manhood
his primary fact, and overthrows that too by refusing
the Son of Man a human soul. The Lord is neither
truly God nor truly man, and therefore is no true
mediator. Heathenism may dream of a true communion
with the Supreme, but for us there neither is
nor ever can be any. Between our Father and ourselves
there is a great gulf fixed, which neither he nor
we can pass. Now that we have heard the message
of the Lord, we know the final certainty that God is
darkness, and in him is no light at all. If this be
the sum of the whole matter, then revelation is a
mockery, and Christ is dead in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Athanasius <i>de
Incarnatione</i>.</div>

<p>Arius was but one of many who were measuring
the heights of heaven with their puny logic, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
sounding the deeps of Wisdom with the plummet of
the schools. Men who agreed in nothing else agreed
in this practical subordination of revelation
to philosophy. Sabellius, for example, had
reduced the Trinity to three successive manifestations
of the one God in the Law, the Gospel, and the
Church; yet even he agreed with Arius in a philosophical
doctrine of the unity of God which was inconsistent
with a real incarnation. Even the noble work
of Origen had helped to strengthen the philosophical
influences which were threatening to overwhelm the
definite historic revelation. Tertullian had long since
warned the churches of the danger; but a greater
than Tertullian was needed now to free them from
their bondage to philosophy. Are we to worship the
Father of our spirits or the Supreme of the philosophers?
Arius put the question: the answer came
from Athanasius. Though his <i>De Incarnatione Verbi
Dei</i> was written in early manhood, before the rise of
Arianism, we can already see in it the firm grasp of
fundamental principles which enabled him so thoroughly
to master the controversy when it came before him.
He starts from the beginning, with the doctrine that
God is good and not envious, and that His goodness
is shown in the creation, and more especially by the
creation of man in the image of God, whereby he
was to remain in bliss and live the true life, the life
of the saints in Paradise. But when man sinned, he
not only died, but fell into the entire corruption summed
up in death; for this is the full meaning of the threat
'ye shall die with death.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> So things went on from
bad to worse on earth. The image of God was disappearing,
and the whole creation going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> destruction.
What then was God to do? He could not take back
his sentence that death should follow sin, and yet he
could not allow the creatures of his love to perish.
Mere repentance on man's side could not touch the
law of sin; a word from God forbidding the approach
of death would not reach the inner corruption. Angels
could not help, for it was not in the image of angels
that man was made. Only he who is himself the Life
could conquer death. Therefore the immortal Word
took human flesh and gave his mortal body for us all.
It was no necessity of his nature so to do, but a pure
outcome of his love to men and of the Father's loving
purpose of salvation. By receiving in himself the
principle of death he overcame it, not in his own
person only, but in all of us who are united with him.
If we do not yet see death abolished, it is now no more
than the passage to our joyful resurrection. Our mortal
human nature is joined with life in him, and clothed
in the asbestos robe of immortality. Thus, and only
thus, in virtue of union with him, can man become a
sharer of his victory. There is no limit to the sovereignty
of Christ in heaven and earth and hell. Wherever
the creation has gone before, the issues of the
incarnation must follow after. See, too, what he has
done among us, and judge if his works are not the
works of sovereign power and goodness. The old fear
of death is gone. Our children tread it underfoot, our
women mock at it. Even the barbarians have laid
aside their warfare and their murders, and live at his
bidding a new life of peace and purity. Heathenism
is fallen, the wisdom of the world is turned to folly,
the oracles are dumb, the demons are confounded. T<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>he
gods of all the nations are giving place to the one true
God of mankind. The works of Christ are more in
number than the sea, his victories are countless as
the waves, his presence is brighter than the sunlight.

<div class="sidenote">Its
significance.</div>

<p>The great persecution had been raging but a
few years back, and the changes which had passed
since then were enough to stir the enthusiasm
of the dullest Christian. These splendid
paragraphs are the song of victory over
the defeat of the Pharaohs of heathenism and the
deliverance of the churches from the house of bondage.
'Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed
gloriously.' There is something in them higher than
the fierce exultation of Lactantius over the sufferings
of the dying persecutors, though that too is impressive.
'The Lord hath heard our prayers. The men
who strove with God lie low; the men who overthrew
his churches have themselves fallen with a mightier
overthrow; the men who tortured the righteous have
surrendered their guilty spirits under the blows of
Heaven and in tortures well deserved though long
delayed&mdash;yet delayed only that posterity might learn
the full terrors of God's vengeance on his enemies.'
There is none of this fierce joy in Athanasius, though
he too had seen the horrors of the persecution, and
some of his early teachers had perished in it. His
eyes are fixed on the world-wide victory of the Eternal
Word, and he never lowers them to resent the evil
wrought by men of yesterday. Therefore neither
lapse of time nor multiplicity of trials could ever
quench in Athanasius the pure spirit of hope which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
glows in his youthful work. Slight as our sketch
of it has been, it will be enough to show his combination
of religious intensity with a speculative insight
and a breadth of view reminding us of Origen.
If he fails to reach the mystery of sinlessness in man,
and is therefore not quite free from a Sabellianising
view of the Lord's humanity as a mere vesture of
his divinity, he at least rises far above the barren
logic of the Arians. We shall presently have to
compare him with the next great Eastern thinker,
Apollinarius of Laodicea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attraction of
Arianism: (1.)
For superficial
thinkers.</div>

<p>Yet there were many men whom Arianism suited
by its shallowness. As soon as Christianity was
established as a lawful worship by the edict
of Milan in 312, the churches were crowded
with converts and inquirers of all sorts.
A church which claims to be universal cannot pick
and choose like a petty sect, but must receive all
comers. Now these were mostly heathens with the
thinnest possible varnish of Christianity, and Arianism
enabled them to use the language of Christians without
giving up their heathen ways of thinking. In
other words, the world was ready to accept the gospel
as a sublime monotheism, and the Lord's divinity was
the one great stumbling-block which seemed to hinder
its conversion. Arianism was therefore a welcome
explanation of the difficulty. Nor was the attraction
only for nominal Christians like these. Careless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
thinkers&mdash;sometimes thinkers who were not careless&mdash;might
easily suppose that Arianism had the best
of such passages as 'The Lord created me,'<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or 'The
Father is greater than I.'<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Athanasius constantly
complains of the Arian habit of relying on isolated
passages like these without regard to their context
or to the general scope and drift of Scripture.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Prov. viii. 22, LXX mistranslation.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) To thoughtful
men.</div>

<p>Nor was even this all. The Lord's divinity was
a real difficulty to thoughtful men. They were still
endeavouring to reconcile the philosophical
idea of God with the fact of the incarnation.
In point of fact, the two things are incompatible,
and one or the other would have to be abandoned.
The absolute simplicity of the divine nature is consistent
with a merely external Trinity, or with a merely
economic Trinity, with an Arian Trinity of one increate
and two created beings, or with a Sabellian Trinity of
three temporal aspects of the one God revealed in
history; but not with a Christian Trinity of three
eternal aspects of the divine nature, facing inward on
each other as well as outward on the world. But this
was not yet fully understood. The problem was to
explain the Lord's distinction from the Father without
destroying the unity of God. Sabellianism did it at
the cost of his premundane and real personality, and
therefore by common consent was out of the question.
The Easterns were more inclined to theories of subordination,
to distinctions of the derivatively from the
absolutely divine, and to views of Christ as a sort of
secondary God. Such theories do not really meet the
difficulty. A secondary God is necessarily a second
God. Thus heathenism still held the key of the
position, and constantly threatened to convict them of
polytheism. They could not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>sit still, yet they could
not advance without remodelling their central doctrine
of the divine nature to agree with revelation. Nothing
could be done till the Trinity was placed inside the
divine <i>nature</i>. But this is just what they could not
for a long time see. These men were not Arians, for
they recoiled in genuine horror from the polytheistic
tendencies of Arianism; but they had no logical defence
against Arianism, and were willing to see if some
modification of it would not give them a foothold of
some kind. To men who dreaded the return of Sabellian
confusion, Arianism was at least an error in the
right direction. It upheld the same truth as they&mdash;the
separate personality of the Son of God&mdash;and if it went
further than they could follow, it might still do service
against the common enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arianism at
Alexandria.</div>

<p>Thus the new theory made a great sensation at
Alexandria, and it was not without much hesitation
and delay that Alexander ventured to excommunicate
his heterodox presbyter with
his chief followers, like Pistus, Carpones, and the
deacon Euzoius&mdash;all of whom we shall meet again.
Arius was a dangerous enemy. His austere life and
novel doctrines, his dignified character and championship
of 'common sense in religion,' made him the idol
of the ladies and the common people. He had plenty
of telling arguments for them. 'Did the Son of God
exist before his generation?' Or to the women,
'Were you a mother before you had a child?' He knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
also how to cultivate his popularity by pastoral visiting&mdash;his
enemies called it canvassing&mdash;and by issuing a
multitude of theological songs 'for sailors and millers
and wayfarers,' as one of his admirers says. So he set
the bishop at defiance, and more than held his ground
against him. The excitement spread to every village
in Egypt, and Christian divisions became a pleasant
subject for the laughter of the heathen theatres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And elsewhere.</div>

<p>The next step was to secure outside support. Arius
betook himself to C&aelig;sarea in Palestine, and thence
appealed to the Eastern churches generally.
Nor did he look for help in vain. His
doctrine fell in with the prevailing dread of Sabellianism,
his personal misfortunes excited interest, his
dignified bearing commanded respect, and his connection
with the school of Lucian secured him learned and
influential sympathy. Great Syrian bishops like those
of C&aelig;sarea, Tyre, and Laodicea gave him more or less
encouragement; and when the old Lucianist Eusebius
of Nicomedia held a council in Bithynia to demand his
recall, it became clear that the controversy was more than
a local dispute. Arius even boasted that the Eastern
bishops agreed with him, 'except a few heretical and
ill-taught men,' like those of Antioch and Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantine's
interference.</div>

<p>The Eastern Emperor, Licinius, let the dispute take
its course. He was a rude old heathen soldier, and
could only let it alone. If Eusebius of
Nicomedia tried to use his influence in
favour of Arius, he had small success. But when
the battle of Chrysopolis (323) laid the Empire at
the feet of Constantine, it seemed time to
get the question somehow settled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><i>THE COUNCIL OF NIC&AElig;A.</i></h3>


<div class="sidenote">State of the
Empire.</div>

<p>For nearly twenty years after the middle of the third
century, the Roman Empire seemed given over to
destruction. It is hard to say whether
the provinces suffered more from the inroads
of barbarians who ravaged them almost at their will,
or from the exactions of a mutinous soldiery who set
up an emperor for almost every army; yet both calamities
were surpassed by the horrors of a pestilence
which swept away the larger part of mankind. There
was little hope in an effete polytheism, still less in a
corrupt and desponding society. The emperors could
not even make head against their foreign enemies.
Decius was killed in battle with the Goths, Valerian
captured by the Persians. But the Teuton was not
yet ready to be the heir of the world. Valerian left
behind a school of generals who were able, even in
those evil days, to restore the Empire to something
like its former splendour. Claudius began by breaking
the power of the Goths at Naissus in 269. Aurelian
(270-275) made a firm peace with the Goths, and
also recovered the provinces. Tetricus and Zenobia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the Gaulish C&aelig;sar and the Syrian queen, adorned the
triumph of their conqueror. The next step was for
Diocletian (284-305) to reform the civil power and
reduce the army to obedience. Unfortunately his
division of the Empire into more manageable parts led
to a series of civil wars, which lasted till its reunion
by Constantine in 323. His religious policy was a
still worse failure. Instead of seeing in Christianity
the one remaining hope of mankind, he set himself at
the end of his reign to stamp it out, and left his
successors to finish the hopeless task. Here again
Constantine repaired Diocletian's error. The edict of
Milan in 312 put an end to the great persecution, and
a policy of increasing favour soon removed all danger
of Christian disaffection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantine.</div>

<p>When Constantine stood out before the world as
the patron of the gospel, he felt bound to settle the
question of Arianism. In some ways he
was well qualified for the task. There can
be no doubt of his ability and earnestness, or of his
genuine interest in Christianity. In political skill he
was an overmatch for Diocletian, and his military successes
were unequalled since the triumph of Aurelian.
The heathens saw in him the restorer of the Empire,
the Christians their deliverer from persecution. Even
the feeling of a divine mission, which laid him so open
to flattery, gave him also a keen desire to remedy the
social misery around him; and in this he looked for
help to Christianity. Amidst the horrors of Diocletian's
persecution a conviction grew upon him that
the power which fought the Empire with success must
somehow come from the Supreme. Thus he slowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
learned to recognise the God of the Christians in
his father's God, and in the Sun-god's cross of light
to see the cross of Christ. But in Christianity itself
he found little more than a confirmation of natural
religion. Therefore, with all his interest in the
churches, he could not reach the secret of their inner
life. Their imposing monotheism he fully appreciated,
but the person of the Lord was surely a minor question.
Constantine shared the heathen feelings of his time,
so that the gospel to him was only a monotheistic
heathenism. Thus Arianism came up to his idea of
it, and the whole controversy seemed a mere affair of
words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His view of the
controversy.</div>

<p>But if he had no theological interest in the question,
he could not overlook its political importance. Egypt
was always a difficult province to manage;
and if these Arian songs caused a bloody
tumult in Alexandria, he could not let the Christians
fight out their quarrels in the streets, as the Jews were
used to do. The Donatists had given him trouble
enough over a disputed election in Africa, and he did
not want a worse than Donatist quarrel in Egypt.
Nor was the danger confined to Egypt; it had already
spread through the East. The unity of Christendom
was at peril, and with it the support which the
shattered Empire looked for from an undivided church.
The state could treat with a definite organisation of
churches, but not with miscellaneous gatherings of
sectaries. The question must therefore be settled one
way or the other, and settled at once. Which way it
was decided mattered little, so that an end was made
of the disturbance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">His first
attempt to
settle it.</div>

<p>In this temper Constantine approached the difficulty.
His first step was to send Hosius of Cordova
to Alexandria with a letter to Alexander
and Arius representing the question as a
battle of words about mysteries beyond our
reach. In the words of a modern writer, 'It was the
excess of dogmatism founded upon the most abstract
words in the most abstract region of human thought.'
It had all arisen out of an over-curious question asked
by Alexander, and a rash answer given by Arius. It
was a childish quarrel and unworthy of sensible men
like them, besides being very distressing to himself.
Had the dispute been really trifling, such a letter might
have had a chance of quieting it. Instead of this, the
excitement grew worse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summons of
the council.</div>

<p>Constantine enlarged his plans. If Arian doctrine
disturbed Alexandria, Meletius of Lycopolis was giving
quite as much trouble about discipline
farther up the Nile, and the old disputes
about the time of Easter had never been effectually
settled. There were also minor questions about the
validity of baptism administered by the followers of
Novatian and Paul of Samosata, and about the treatment
of those who had denied the faith during the
persecution of Licinius. Constantine, therefore, invited
all Christian bishops inside and outside the
Empire to meet him at Nic&aelig;a in Bithynia during the
summer of 325, in order to make a final end of all
the disputes which endangered the unity of Christendom.
The 'city of victory' bore an auspicious
name, and the restoration of peace was a holy
service, and would be a noble preparation for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
solemnities of the great Emperor's twentieth year upon
the throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
&oelig;cumenical
council.</div>

<p>The idea of a general or &oelig;cumenical council (the
words mean the same thing) may well have been Constantine's
own. It bears the mark of a
statesman's mind, and is of a piece with the
rest of his life. Constantine was not thinking
only of the questions to be debated. However
these might be settled, the meeting could not fail to
draw nearer to the state and to each other the churches
of that great confederation which later ages have so
often mistaken for the church of Christ. As regards
Arianism, smaller councils had been a frequent means
of settling smaller questions. Though Constantine had
not been able to quiet the Donatists by means of the
Council of Arles, he might fairly hope that the authority
of such a gathering as this would bear down all resistance.
If he could only bring the bishops to some
decision, the churches might be trusted to follow it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its members.</div>

<p>An imposing list of bishops answered Constantine's
call. The signatures are 223, but they are
not complete. The Emperor speaks of 300, and
tradition gives 318, like the number of
Abraham's servants, or like the mystic
number<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which stands for the cross of Christ. From
the far west came his chief adviser for the Latin
churches, the patriarch of councils, the old confessor
Hosius of Cordova. Africa was represented by C&aelig;cilian
of Carthage, round whose election the whole Donatist
controversy had arisen, and a couple of presbyters
answered for the apostolic and imperial see of Rome.
Of the thirteen great provinces of the Empire none
was missing except distant Britain; but t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>he Western
bishops were almost lost in the crowd of Easterns.
From Egypt came Alexander of Alexandria with his
young deacon Athanasius, and the Coptic confessors
Paphnutius and Potammon, each with an eye seared
out, came from cities farther up the Nile. All these
were resolute enemies of Arianism; its only Egyptian
supporters were two bishops from the edge of the
western desert. Syria was less unequally divided. If
Eustathius of Antioch and Macarius of &AElig;lia (we know
that city better as Jerusalem) were on Alexander's side,
the bishops of Tyre and Laodicea with the learned
Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea leaned the other way or took a
middle course. Altogether there were about a dozen
more or less decided Arianizers thinly scattered over
the country from the slopes of Taurus to the Jordan
valley. Of the Pontic bishops we need notice only
Marcellus of Ancyra and the confessor Paul of Neoc&aelig;sarea.
Arianism had no friends in Pontus to our
knowledge, and Marcellus was the busiest of its
enemies. Among the Asiatics, however, there was a
small but influential group of Arianizers, disciples of
Lucian like Arius himself. Chief of these was Eusebius
of Nicomedia, who was rather a court politician than a
student like his namesake of C&aelig;sarea, and might be
expected to influence the Emperor as much as any one.
With him went the bishops of Ephesus and Nic&aelig;a
itself, and Maris of Chalcedon. The Greeks of Europe
were few and unimportant, but on the outskirts of the
Empire we find some names of great interest. James
of Nisibis represented the old Syrian churches which
spoke the Lord's own native language. Restaces
the Armenian could remind the bishops that Armenia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
was in Christ before Rome, and had fought the persecutors
in their cause. Theophilus the Goth might tell
them the modest beginnings of Teutonic Christianity
among his countrymen of the Crimean undercliff. John
the Persian, who came from one or another of the many
distant regions which bore the name of India, may
dimly remind ourselves of the great Nestorian missions
which one day were to make the Christian name a
power in Northern China. Little as Eusebius of
C&aelig;sarea liked some issues of the council, he is full of
genuine enthusiasm over his majestic roll of churches
far and near, from the extremity of Europe to the
farthest ends of Asia. Not without the Holy Spirit's
guidance did that august assembly meet. Nor was its
meeting a day of hope for the churches only, but also for
the weary Empire. In that great crisis the deep despair
of ages was forgotten. It might be that the power
which had overcome the world could also cure its ancient
sickness. Little as men could see into the issues of the
future, the meaning of the present was beyond mistake.
The new world faced the old, and all was ready for the
league which joined the names of Rome and Christendom,
and made the sway of Christ and C&aelig;sar one.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_5" id="Footnote_1_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_5"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> 318; in Greek [Greek: ti&ecirc;].</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">The idea of a
test creed.</div>

<p>It seems to have been understood that the council
was to settle the question by drawing up a creed
as a test for bishops. Here was a twofold
novelty. In the first place, Christendom as
a whole had as yet no written creed at all. The so-called
Apostles' Creed may be older than 340, but
then it first appears, and only as a personal confession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of the heretic Marcellus. Every church taught its
catechumens the historic outlines of the faith, and
referred to Scripture as the storehouse and final test
of doctrine. But that doctrine was not embodied in
forms of more than local currency. Thus different
churches had varying creeds to form the basis of the
catechumen's teaching, and placed varying professions in
his mouth at baptism. Some of these were ancient, and
some of widespread use, and all were much alike, for all
were couched in Scripture language, variously modelled
on the Lord's baptismal formula (Matt. xxviii. 19). At
Jerusalem, for example, the candidate declared his faith:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">in the Father;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">in the Son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">in the Holy Spirit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">and in one Baptism of Repentance.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Roman form, as approximately given by Novatian
in the middle of the third century, was,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I believe in God the Father,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">the Lord Almighty;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">in Christ Jesus his Son,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">the Lord our God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">and in the Holy Spirit.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though these local usages were not disturbed, it was
none the less a momentous step to draw up a document
for all the churches. Its use as a test for bishops was
a further innovation. Purity of doctrine was for a
long time guarded by Christian public opinion. If
a bishop taught novelties, the neighbouring churches
(not the clergy only) met in conference on them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
refused his communion if they proved unsound. Of
late years these conferences had been growing into
formal councils of bishops, and the legal recognition of
the churches by Gallienus (261)
enabled them
to take the further step of deposing false
teachers. Aurelian had sanctioned this in the case of
Paul of Samosata by requiring communion with the
bishops of Rome and Italy as the legal test
of Christian orthodoxy (272)
there were
practical difficulties in this plan of government by
councils. A strong party might dispute the sentence,
or even get up rival councils to reverse it. The African
Donatists had given Constantine trouble enough
of this sort some years before; and now that the
Arians were following their example, it was evident
that every local quarrel would have an excellent chance
of becoming a general controversy. In the interest,
therefore, of peace and unity, it seemed better to adopt
a written test. If a bishop was willing to sign it
when asked, his subscription should be taken as a full
reply to every charge of heresy which might be made
against him. On this plan, whatever was left out of
the creed would be deliberately left an open question
in the churches. Whatever a bishop might choose to
teach (Arianism, for example), he would have full protection,
unless some clause of the new creed expressly
shut it out. This is a point which must be kept
in view when we come to estimate the conduct of
Athanasius. Thus however Constantine hoped to
make the bishops keep the peace over such trumpery
questions as this of Arianism seemed to him. Had it
been a trumpery question, his policy might have had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
some chance of lasting success. For the moment, at
any rate, all parties accepted it, so that the council
had only to settle the wording of the new creed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arianism condemned.</div>

<p>The Arians must have come full of hope to the
council. So far theirs was the winning side. They
had a powerful friend at court in the
Emperor's sister, Constantia, and an influential
connection in the learned Lucianic circle.
Reckoning also on the natural conservatism of Christian
bishops, on the timidity of some, and on the simplicity
or ignorance of others, they might fairly expect that
if their doctrine was not accepted by the council, it
would at least escape formal condemnation. They hoped,
however, to carry all before them. An Arianizing creed
was therefore presented by a score or so of bishops,
headed by the courtier Eusebius of Nicomedia. They
soon found their mistake. The Lord's divinity was
not an open question in the churches. The bishops
raised an angry clamour and tore the offensive creed
in pieces. Arius was at once abandoned by nearly
all his friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eusebius proposes
the creed
of C&aelig;sarea.</div>

<p>This was decisive. Arianism was condemned almost
unanimously, and nothing remained but to put on record
the decision. But here began the difficulty.
Marcellus and Athanasius wanted it put into
the creed, but the bishops in general saw
no need of this. A heresy so easily overcome could
not be very dangerous. There were only half a dozen
Arians left in the council, and too precise a definition
might lead to dangers on the Sabellian side. At this
point the historian Eusebius came forward. Though
neither a great man nor a clear thinker, he was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
most learned student of the East. He had been a
confessor in the persecution, and now occupied an important
see, and stood high in the Emperor's favour.
With regard to doctrine, he held a sort of intermediate
position, regarding the Lord not indeed as a creature,
but as a secondary God derived from the will of the
Father. This, as we have seen, was the idea then
current in the East, that it is possible to find some
middle term between the creature and the highest
deity. To a man of this sort it seemed natural to fall
back on the authority of some older creed, such as all
could sign. He therefore laid before the council that
of his own church of C&aelig;sarea, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We believe in one God, the Father Almighty,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And in the Holy Spirit.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Had the council been drawing up a creed for popular
use, a short and simple document of this kind would
have been suitable enough. The undecided bishops
received it with delight. It contained none of the
vexatious technical terms which had done all the
mischief&mdash;nothing but familiar Scripture, which the
least learned of them could understand. So far as
Arianism might mean to deny the Lord's divinity, it
was clearly condemned already, and the whole question
might now be safely left at rest behind the ambiguities
of the C&aelig;sarean creed. So it was accepted at
once. Marcellus himself could find no fault with its
doctrine, and the Arians were glad now to escape
a direct condemnation. But unanimity of this sort,
which really decided nothing, was not what Athanasius
and Marcellus wanted. They had not come to the
council to haggle over compromises, but to cast out the
blasphemer, and they were resolved to do it effectually.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persistence
of Athanasius.</div>

<p>Hardly a more momentous resolution can be found
in history. The whole future of Christianity was
determined by it; and we must fairly face
the question whether Athanasius was right
or not. Would it not have been every way better
to rest satisfied with the great moral victory already
gained? When heathens were pressing into the
church in crowds, was that a suitable time to offend
them with a solemn proclamation of the very doctrine
which chiefly kept them back? It was, moreover, a
dangerous policy to insist on measures for which even
Christian opinion was not ripe, and it led directly to
the gravest troubles in the churches&mdash;troubles of which
no man then living was to see the end. The first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
half century of prelude was a war of giants; but the
main contest opened at Nic&aelig;a is not ended yet, or like
to end before the Lord himself shall come to end it.
It was the decision of Athanasius which made half
the bitterness between the Roman and the Teuton,
between Christianity and Islam to this day. Even
now it is the worst stumbling-block of Western unbelief.
Many of our most earnest enemies would
gladly forget their enmity if we would only drop our
mysticism and admire with them a human Christ who
never rose with power from the dead. But we may
not do this thing. Christianity cannot make its peace
with this world by dropping that message from the
other which is its only reason for existence. Athanasius
was clearly right. When Constantine had
fairly put the question, they could not refuse to
answer. Let the danger be what it might, they could
not deliberately leave it open for Christian bishops
(the creed was not for others) to dispute whether our
Lord is truly God or not. Those may smile to whom
all revelation is a vain thing; but it is our life, and
we believe it is their own life too. If there is truth
or even meaning in the gospel, this question of all
others is most surely vital. Nor has history failed to
justify Athanasius. That heathen age was no time to
trifle with heathenism in the very citadel of Christian
life. Fresh from the fiery trial of the last great persecution,
whose scarred and mutilated veterans were
sprinkled through the council-hall, the church of God
was entering on a still mightier conflict with the spirit
of the world. If their fathers had been faithful unto
death or saved a people from the world, their sons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
would have to save the world itself and tame its
Northern conquerors. Was that a time to say of
Christ, 'But as for this man, we know not whence
he is'?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revision of the
C&aelig;sarean
creed.</div>

<p>Athanasius and his friends made a virtue of necessity,
and disconcerted the plans of Eusebius by
promptly accepting his creed. They were
now able to propose a few amendments in
it, and in this way they meant to fight out
the controversy. It was soon found impossible to
avoid a searching revision. Ill-compacted clauses invited
rearrangement, and older churches, like Jerusalem
or Antioch, might claim to share with C&aelig;sarea the
honour of giving a creed to the whole of Christendom.
Moreover, several of the C&aelig;sarean phrases seemed to
favour the opinions which the bishops had agreed to
condemn. 'First-born of all creation' does not necessarily
mean more than that he existed before other
things were made. 'Begotten before all worlds' is
just as ambiguous, or rather worse, for the Arians
understood 'begotten' to mean 'created.' Again, 'was
made flesh' left it unsettled whether the Lord took
anything more than a human body. These were
serious defects, and the bishops could not refuse to
amend them. After much careful work, the following
was the form adopted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its doctrine.</div>

<p>It will be seen that the genuine Nicene Creed here
given differs in almost every clause from the so-called
Nicene Creed of our Communion Service.
Leaving, however, the spurious Nicene Creed
till we come to it, let us see how the genuine Nicene
Creed dealt with Arianism. Its central phrases are
the two which refer to essence. Now the <i>essence</i> of a
thing is that by which it is what we suppose it to be.
We look at it from various points of view, and ascribe
to it first one quality and then another. Its <i>essence</i>
from any one of these successive points of view is that by
which it possesses the corresponding quality. About
this unknown something we make no assertion, so that
we are committed to no theory whatever. Thus the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
<i>essence</i> of the Father <i>as God</i> (for this was the point of
view) is that unknown and incommunicable something
by which He is God. If therefore we explain St. John's
'an only-begotten who is God'<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> inserting 'that is,
from the <i>essence</i> of the Father,' we declare that the
Divine Sonship is no accident of will, but belongs to the
divine nature. It is not an outside matter of creation
or adoption, but (so to speak) an organic relation inside
that nature. The Father is no more God without the
Son than the Son is God without the Father. Again,
if we confess him to be <i>of one essence</i> with the Father,
we declare him the common possessor with the Father
of the one essence which no creature can share, and
thus ascribe to him the highest deity in words which
allow no evasion or reserve. The two phrases, however,
are complementary. <i>From the essence</i> makes a
clear distinction: <i>of one essence</i> lays stress on the unity.
The word had a Sabellian history, and was used by
Marcellus in a Sabellian sense, so that it was justly
discredited as Sabellian. Had it stood alone, the
creed would have been Sabellian; but at Nic&aelig;a it was
checked by <i>from the essence</i>. When the later Nicenes,
under Semiarian influence, came to give the word
another meaning, the check was wisely removed.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_7" id="Footnote_1_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_7"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> John i. 18 (the best reading, and certainly familiar in the Nicene
age).</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Its caution.</div>

<p>Upon the whole, the creed is a cautious document.
Though Arianism is attacked again in the clause <i>was
made man</i>, which states that the Lord took
something more than a human body, there
is no attempt to forestall later controversies by a further
definition of the meaning of the incarnation. The
abrupt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> pause after the mention of the Holy Spirit is
equally significant, for the nature of his divinity was
still an open question. Even the heretics are not
cursed, for anathema in the Nicene age was no more
than the penalty which to a layman was equivalent to
the deposition of a cleric. It meant more when it was
launched against the dead two hundred years later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arian
objections.</div>

<p>Our accounts of the debate are very fragmentary.
Eusebius passes over an unpleasant subject, and
Athanasius up and down his writings only
tells us what he wants for his immediate
purpose. Thus we cannot trace many of the Arian
objections to the creed. Knowing, however, as we
do that they were carefully discussed, we may presume
that they were the standing difficulties of the
next generation. These were four in number:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) 'From the essence' and 'of one essence' are
materialist expressions, implying either that the Son is
a separate part of the essence of the Father, or that
there is some third essence prior to both. This objection
was a difficulty in the East, and still more in the
West, where 'essence' was represented by the materializing
word <i>substantia</i>, from which we get our unfortunate
translation 'of one substance.'</p>

<p>(2.) 'Of one essence' is Sabellian. This was true;
and the defenders of the word did not seem to care
if it was true. Marcellus almost certainly used incautious
language, and it was many years before even
Athanasius was fully awake to the danger from the
Sabellian side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>(3.) The words 'essence' and 'of one essence' are
not found in Scripture. This is what seems to have
influenced the bishops most of all.</p>

<p>(4.) 'Of one essence' is contrary to church authority.
This also was true, for the word had been rejected as
materializing by a large council held at Antioch in
269 against Paul of Samosata. The point, however,
at present raised was not that it had been rejected for
a good reason, but simply that it had been rejected;
and this is an appeal to church authority in the style
of later times. The question was one of Scripture
against church authority. Both parties indeed accepted
Scripture as supreme, but when they differed in its
interpretation, the Arians pleaded that a word not
sanctioned by church authority could not be made a
test of orthodoxy. If tradition gave them a foothold
(and none could deny it), they thought themselves
entitled to stay; if Scripture condemned them (and
there could be no doubt of that), Athanasius thought
himself bound to turn them out. It was on the ground
of Scripture that the fathers of Nic&aelig;a took their stand,
and the works of Athanasius, from first to last, are
one continuous appeal to Scripture. In this case he
argues that if the disputed word is not itself Scripture,
its meaning is. This was quite enough; but if the
Arians chose to drag in antiquarian questions, they
might easily be met on that ground also, for the word
had been used or recognised by Origen and others
at Alexandria. With regard to its rejection by the
Syrian churches, he refuses all mechanical comparisons
of date or numbers between the councils of Antioch
and Nic&aelig;a, and endeavours to show that while Paul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of Samosata had used the word in one sense, Arius
denied it in another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hesitation of
the council.</div>

<p>The council paused. The confessors in particular
were an immense conservative force. If Hosius and
Eustathius had been forward in attacking
Arianism, few of them can have greatly
wished to re-state the faith which had sustained them
in their trial. Now the creed involved something like
a revolution. The idea of a universal test was in itself
a great change, best softened as much as might be.
The insertion of a direct condemnation of Arianism
was a still more serious step, and though the bishops
had consented to it, they had not consented without
misgiving. But when it was proposed to use a word
of doubtful tendency, neither found in Scripture nor
sanctioned by church authority, it would have been
strange if they had not looked round for some escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arian
evasions.</div>

<p>Yet what escape was possible? Scripture can be
used as a test if its authority is called in question,
but not when its meaning is disputed.
If the Arians were to be excluded, it
was useless to put into the creed the very words
whose plain meaning they were charged with evading.
Athanasius gives an interesting account of
this stage of the debate. It appears that when the
bishops collected phrases from Scripture and set down
that the Son is 'of God,' those wicked Arians said
to each other, 'We can sign that, for we ourselves
also are of God. Is it not written, All things are
of God?'<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> So when the bishops saw their impious
ingenuity, they put it more clearly, that the Son is
not only of God like the creatures, but of the essence
of God. And this was the reas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>on why the word
'essence' was put into the creed. Again, the Arians
were asked if they would confess that the Son is not
a creature, but the power and eternal image of the
Father and true God. Instead of giving a straightforward
answer, they were caught whispering to each
other. 'This is true of ourselves, for we men are
called the image and glory of God.<a name="FNanchor_2_9" id="FNanchor_2_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_9" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> We too are
eternal, for we who live are always.<a name="FNanchor_3_10" id="FNanchor_3_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_10" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And powers
of God are many. Is He not the Lord of powers
(hosts)? The locust and the caterpillar are actually
"my great power which I sent among you."<a name="FNanchor_4_11" id="FNanchor_4_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_11" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He
is true God also, for he became true God as soon
as he was created.' These were the evasions which
compelled the bishops to sum up the sense of Scripture
in the statement that the Son is of one essence with
the Father.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Acceptance of
the creed.</div>

<p>So far Athanasius. The longer the debate went on,
the clearer it became that the meaning of Scripture
could not be defined without going outside
Scripture for words to define it. In the
end, they all signed except a few. Many, however,
signed with misgivings, and some almost avowedly
as a formality to please the Emperor. 'The soul is
none the worse for a little ink.' It is not a pleasant
scene for the historian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The letter of
Eusebius.</div>

<p>Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea was sorely disappointed.
Instead of giving a creed to Christendom, he received
back his confession in a form which at first he could
not sign at all. There was some ground for his
complaint that, under pretence of inserting
the single word of <i>one essence</i>, which our
wise and godly Emperor so admirably explained, the
bishops had in effect drawn up a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>composition of their
own. It was a venerable document of stainless
orthodoxy, and they had laid rude hands on almost
every clause of it. Instead of a confession which
secured the assent of all parties by deciding nothing,
they forced on him a stringent condemnation, not
indeed of his own belief, but of opinions held by
many of his friends, and separated by no clear logical
distinction from his own. But now was he to sign
or not? Eusebius was not one of the hypocrites,
and would not sign till his scruples were satisfied.
He tells us them in a letter to the people of his
diocese, which he wrote under the evident feeling that
his signature needed some apology. First he gives
their own C&aelig;sarean creed, and protests his unchanged
adherence to it. Then he relates its unanimous
acceptance, subject to the insertion of the single word
<i>of one essence</i>, which Constantine explained to be
directed against materializing and unspiritual views
of the divine generation. But it emerged from the
debates in so altered a form that he could not sign
it without careful examination. His first scruple was
at <i>of the essence of the Father</i>, which was explained
as not meant to imply any materializing separation.
So, for the sake of peace, he was willing to accept
it, as well as <i>of one essence</i>, now that he could do it
with a good conscience. Similarly, <i>begotten, not made</i>,
was explained to mean that the Son has nothing in
common with the creatures made by him, but is of
a higher essence, ineffably begotten of the Father.
So also, on careful consideration, <i>of one essence with the
Father</i> implies no more than the uniqueness of the
Son's generation, and his distinctness from the creatures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Other expressions prove equally innocent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constantine's
interference.</div>

<p>Now that a general agreement had been reached,
it was time for Constantine to interpose. He had
summoned the council as a means of union,
and enforced his exhortation to harmony by
burning the letters of recrimination which the bishops
had presented to him. To that text he still adhered.
He knew too little of the controversy to have any very
strong personal opinion, and the influences which might
have guided him were divided. If Hosius of Cordova
leaned to the Athanasian side, Eusebius of Nicomedia
was almost Arian. If Constantine had any feeling in the
matter&mdash;dislike, for example, of the popularity of Arius&mdash;he
was shrewd enough not to declare it too hastily.
If he tried to force a view of his own on the undecided
bishops, he might offend half Christendom; but if
he waited for the strongest force inside the council to
assert itself, he might safely step in at the end to
coerce the recusants. Therefore whatever pleased the
council pleased the Emperor too. When they tore up
the Arian creed, he approved. When they accepted
the C&aelig;sarean, he approved again. When the morally
strong Athanasian minority urged the council to put
in the disputed clauses, Constantine did his best to
smooth the course of the debate. At last, always in
the interest of unity, he proceeded to put pressure on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the few who still held out. Satisfactory explanations
were given to Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea, and in the end
they all signed but the two Egyptian Arians, Secundus
of Ptolemais and Theonas of Marmarica. These were
sent into exile, as well as Arius himself; and a qualified
subscription from Eusebius of Nicomedia only
saved him for the moment. An imperial rescript
also branded the heretic's followers with the name of
Porphyrians, and ordered his writings to be burnt.
The concealment of a copy was to be a capital
offence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Close of the

<p>Other subjects decided by the council will not
detain us long, though some of its members may have
thought one or two of them quite as
important as Arianism. The old Easter
question was settled in favour of the Roman custom
of observing, not the day of the Jewish passover
in memory of the crucifixion, but a later Sunday
in memory of the resurrection. For how, explains
Constantine&mdash;how could we who are Christians possibly
keep the same day as those wicked Jews? The
council, however, was right on the main point, that the
feasts of Christian worship are not to be tied to those
of Judaism. The third great subject for discussion
was the Meletian schism in Egypt, and this was
settled by a liberal compromise. The Meletian presbyter
might act alone if there was no orthodox
presbyter in the place, otherwise he was to be a
coadjutor with a claim to succeed if found worthy.
Athanasius (at least in later times) would have preferred
severer measures, and more than once refers
to these with unconcealed disgust. The rest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
business disposed of, Constantine dismissed the bishops
with a splendid feast, which Eusebius enthusiastically
likens to the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of the
council.</div>

<p>Let us now sum up the results of the council, so far
as they concern Arianism. In one sense they were
decisive. Arianism was so sharply condemned
by the all but unanimous voice of
Christendom, that nearly thirty years had to pass before
it was openly avowed again. Conservative feeling
in the West was engaged in steady defence of the
great council; and even in the East its doctrine could
be made to wear a conservative aspect as the actual
faith of Christendom. On the other hand, were
serious drawbacks. The triumph was rather a surprise
than a solid victory. As it was a revolution
which a minority had forced through by sheer strength
of clearer thought, a reaction was inevitable when the
half-convinced majority returned home. In other
words, Athanasius had pushed the Easterns farther
than they wished to go, and his victory recoiled on
himself. But he could not retreat when once he had
put the disputed words into the creed. Come what
might, those words were irreversible. And if it was a
dangerous policy which won the victory, the use made
of it was deplorable. Though the exile of Arius and
his friends was Constantine's work, much of the discredit
must fall on the Athanasian leaders, for we cannot
find that they objected to it either at the time or
afterwards. It seriously embittered the controversy.
If the Nicenes set the example of persecution, the
other side improved on it till the whole contest
threatened to degenerate into a series of personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
quarrels and retaliations. The process was only
checked by the common hatred of all parties to
Julian, and by the growth of a better spirit among
the Nicenes, as shown in the later writings of Athanasius.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3><i>THE EUSEBIAN REACTION.</i></h3>


<div class="sidenote">The problem
stated.</div>

<p>At first sight the reaction which followed the Nicene
council is one of the strangest scenes in history. The
decision was clear and all but unanimous.
Arianism seemed crushed for ever by the
universal reprobation of the Christian world. Yet it
instantly renewed the contest, and fought its conquerors
on equal terms for more than half a century.
A reaction like this is plainly more than a court
intrigue. Imperial favour could do a good deal in
the Nicene age, but no emperor could long oppose any
clear and definite belief of Christendom. Nothing
could be plainer than the issue of the council. How
then could Arianism venture to renew the contest?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reaction
rather conservative
than
Arian.</div>

<p>The answer is, that though the belief of the churches
was certainly not Arian, neither was it yet definitely
Nicene. The dominant feeling both in
East and West was one of dislike to change,
which we may conveniently call conservatism.
But here there was a difference. Heresies
in the East had always gathered round the person of
the Lord, and more than one had already partly occupied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the ground of Arianism. Thus Eastern conservatism
inherited a doctrine from the last generation,
and was inclined to look on the Nicene decisions as
questionable innovations. The Westerns thought
otherwise. Leaning on authority as they habitually
did, they cared little to discuss for themselves an
unfamiliar question. They could not even translate
its technical terms into Latin without many misunderstandings.
Therefore Western conservatism simply
fell back on the august decisions of Nic&aelig;a. No later
meeting could presume to rival 'the great and holy
council' where Christendom had once for all pronounced
the condemnation of Arianism. In short,
East and West were alike conservative; but while
conservatism in the East went behind the council, in
the West it was content to start from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supported by
influence of:
(1.) Heathens.</div>

<p>The Eastern reaction was therefore in its essence
not Arian but conservative. Its leaders might be
conservatives like Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea, or
court politicians like his successor, Acacius.
They were never open Arians till 357.
The front and strength of the party was conservative,
and the Arians at its tail were in themselves only a
source of weakness. Yet they could enlist powerful
allies in the cause of reaction. Heathenism was still
a living power in the world. It was strong in numbers
even in the East, and even stronger in the imposing
memories of history. Christianity was still an upstart
on C&aelig;sar's throne. The favour of the gods had built
up the Empire, and men's hearts misgave them that
their wrath might overthrow it. Heathenism was still
an established religion, the Emperor still its official<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
head. Old Rome was still devoted to her ancient
deities, her nobles still recorded their priesthoods and
augurships among their proudest honours, and the
Senate itself still opened every sitting with an offering
of incense on the altar of Victory. The public service
was largely heathen, and the army too, especially its
growing cohorts of barbarian auxiliaries. Education
also was mostly heathen, turning on heathen classics
and taught by heathen rhetoricians. Libanius, the
teacher of Chrysostom, was also the honoured friend of
Julian. Philosophy too was a great influence, now that
it had leagued together all the failing powers of the
ancient world against a rival not of this world. Its
weakness as a moral force must not blind us to its
charm for the imagination. Neoplatonism brought
Egypt to the aid of Greece, and drew on Christianity
itself for help. The secrets of philosophy were set
forth in the mysteries of Eastern superstition. From
the dim background of a noble monotheism the ancient
gods came forth to represent on earth a majesty above
their own. No waverer could face the terrors of that
mighty gathering of infernal powers. And the Nicene
age was a time of unsettlement and change, of half-beliefs
and wavering superstition, of weakness and
unclean frivolity. Above all, society was heathen to
an extent we can hardly realise. The two religions
were strangely mixed. The heathens on their side
never quite understood the idea of worshipping one
God only; while crowds of nominal Christians never
asked for baptism unless a dangerous illness or an
earthquake scared them, and thought it quite enough
to show their faces in church once or twice a year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Meanwhile, they lived just like the heathens round
them, steeped in superstitions like their neighbours,
attending freely their immoral games and dances, and
sharing in the sins connected with them. Thus
Arianism had many affinities with heathenism, in its
philosophical idea of the Supreme, in its worship of a
demigod of the vulgar type, in its rhetorical methods,
and in its generally lower moral tone. Heathen influences
therefore strongly supported Arianism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) Jews.</div>

<p>The Jews also usually took the Arian side. They
were still a power in the world, though it was long
since Israel had challenged Rome to seventy
years of internecine contest for the dominion
of the East. But they had never forgiven her the
destruction of Jehovah's temple.
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 66-135.) Half overcome
themselves by the spell of the eternal
Empire, they still looked vaguely for some Eastern
deliverer to break her impious yoke. Still more
fiercely they resented her adoption of the gospel,
which indeed was no tidings of good-will or peace to
them, but the opening of a thousand years of persecution.
Thus they were a sort of caricature of the
Christian churches. They made every land their own,
yet were aliens in all. They lived subject to the laws
of the Empire, yet gathered into corporations governed
by their own. They were citizens of Rome, yet
strangers to her imperial comprehensiveness. In a
word, they were like a spirit in the body, but a spirit
of uncleanness and of sordid gain. If they hated the
Gentile, they could love his vices notwithstanding.
If the old missionary zeal of Israel was extinct, they
could still purvey impostures for the world. Jewish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
superstitions were the plague of distant Spain, the
despair of Chrysostom at Antioch. Thus the lower
moral tone of Arianism and especially its denial of
the Lord's divinity were enough to secure it a fair
amount of Jewish support as against the Nicenes. At
Alexandria, for example, the Jews were always ready
for lawless outrage at the call of every enemy of
Athanasius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3.) The court.</div>

<p>The court also leaned to Arianism. The genuine
Arians, to do them justice, were not more pliant to
imperial dictation than the Nicenes, but
the genuine Arians were only one section
of a motley coalition. Their conservative patrons and
allies were laid open to court influence by their dread
of Sabellianism; for conservatism is the natural home
of the impatient timidity which looks round at every
difficulty for a saviour of society, and would fain turn
the whole work of government into a crusade against
a series of scarecrows. Thus when Constantius turned
against them, their chiefs were found wanting in the
self-respect which kept both Nicene and Arian leaders
from condescending to a battle of intrigue with such
masters of the art as flourished in the palace. But
for thirty years the intriguers found it their interest
to profess conservatism. The court was as full of
selfish cabals as that of the old French monarchy.
Behind the glittering ceremonial on which the treasures
of the world were squandered fought armies of place-hunters
great and small, cooks and barbers, women
and eunuchs, courtiers and spies, adventurers of every
sort, for ever wresting the majesty of law to private
favour, for ever aiming new oppressions at the men on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
whom the exactions of the Empire already fell with
crushing weight. The noblest bishops, the ablest
generals, were their fairest prey; and we have no
surer witness to the greatness of Athanasius or Julian
than the pertinacious hatred of this odious horde.
Intriguers of this kind found it better to unsettle the
Nicene decisions, on behalf of conservatism forsooth,
than to maintain them in the name of truth. There
were many ways of upsetting them, and each might
lead to gain; only one of defending them, and that
was not attractive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(4.) Asia.</div>

<p>Nor were Constantius and Valens without political
reasons for their support of Arianism. We can see
by the light of later history that the real
centre of the Empire was the solid mass of
Asia from the Bosphorus to Mount Taurus, and that
Constantinople was its outwork on the side of Europe.
In Rome on one side, Egypt and Syria on the other,
we can already trace the tendencies which led to their
separation from the orthodox Eastern Church and
Empire. Now in the fourth century Asia was a
stronghold of conservatism. There was a good deal of
Arianism in Cappadocia, but we hear little of it in
Asia. The group of Lucianists at Nic&aelig;a left neither
Arian nor Nicene successors. The ten provinces of
Asia 'verily knew not God' in Hilary's time; and
even the later Nicene doctrine of Cappadocia was
almost as much Semiarian as Athanasian. Thus Constantius
and Valens pursued throughout an Asiatic
policy, striking with one hand at Egypt, with the other
at Rome. Every change in their action can be explained
with reference to the changes of opinion in Asia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusion.</div>

<p>Upon the whole, we may say that Arian hatred of
the council would have been powerless if it had not
rested on a formidable mass of conservative discontent,
while the conservative discontent
might have died away if the court had not supplied
it with the means of action. If the decision lay
with the majority, every initiative had to come from
the court. Hence the reaction went on as long as
these were agreed against the Nicene party; it was
suspended as soon as Julian's policy turned another
way, became unreal when conservative alarm subsided,
and finally collapsed when Asia went over to the
Nicene side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sequel of the
council.</div>

<p>We may now return to the sequel of the great
council. If Constantine thought he had restored peace
in the churches, he soon found out his mistake.
The literary war began again almost
where his summons had interrupted it. The creed
was signed and done with and seemed forgotten. The
conservatives hardly cared to be reminded of their half
unwilling signatures. To Athanasius it may have
been a watchword from the first, but it was not so to
many others. In the West it was as yet almost unknown.
Even Marcellus was more disposed to avoid
all technical terms than to lay stress on those which
the council sanctioned. Yet all parties had learned
caution at Nic&aelig;a. Marcellus disavowed Sabellianism;
Eusebius avoided Arianism, and nobody seems to have
disowned the creed as long as Constantine lived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Athanasius
bishop of
Alexandria,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 328.</div>

<p>The next great change was at Alexandria. The
bishop Alexander died in the spring of 328, and a
stormy election followed. Its details are obscure, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the Nicene party put forward the deacon Athanasius,
and consecrated him in spite of a determined opposition
from Arians and Meletians. And
now that we stand before the greatest of
the Eastern fathers, let us see how his
character and training fitted him to be the hero of
the Arian controversy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of
Athanasius.</div>

<p>Athanasius was a Greek by birth and education,
Greek also in subtle thought and philosophic insight,
in oratorical power and supple statesmanship.
Though born almost within the
shadow of the mighty temple of Serapis at Alexandria,
he shows few signs of Coptic influence. Deep as is his
feeling of the mystery of revelation, he has no love of
mystery for its own sake, nothing of the Egyptian
passion for things awful and mysterious. Even his
style is clear and simple, without a trace of Egyptian
involution and obscurity. We know nothing of his
family, and cannot even date his birth for certain,
though it must have been very near the year 297.
He was, therefore, old enough to remember the worst
days of the great persecution, which Maximin Daza
kept up in Egypt as late as 313. Legend has of
course been busy with his early life. According to
one story, Alexander found him with some other boys
at play, imitating the ceremonies of baptism&mdash;not a
likely game for a youth of sixteen. Another story
makes him a disciple of the great hermit Antony,
who never existed. He may have been a lawyer for a
time, but in any case his training was neither Coptic
nor monastic, but Greek and scriptural, as became a
scholar of Alexandria. There may be traces of Latin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in his writings, but his allusions to Greek literature are
such as leave no doubt that he had a liberal education.
In his earliest works he refers to Plato; in later years
he quotes Homer, and models his notes on Aristotle, his
<i>Apology</i> to Constantius on Demosthenes. To Egyptian
idolatry he seldom alludes. Scripture, however, is his
chosen and familiar study, and few commentators have
ever shown a firmer grasp of certain of its leading
thoughts. He at least endeavoured (unlike the Arian
text-mongers) to take in the context of his quotations
and the general drift of Christian doctrine. Many
errors of detail may be pardoned to a writer who so
seldom fails in suggestiveness and width of view. In
mere learning he was no match for Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea,
and even as a thinker he has a worthy rival in Hilary
of Poitiers, while some of the Arian leaders were fully
equal to him in political skill. But Eusebius was no
great thinker, Hilary no statesman, and the Arian
leaders were not men of truth. Athanasius, on the
other hand, was philosopher, statesman, and saint in one.
Few great men have ever been so free from littleness
or weakness. At the age of twenty he had risen far
above the level of Arianism and Sabellianism, and
throughout his long career we catch glimpses of a
spiritual depth which few of his contemporaries could
reach. Above all things, his life was consecrated to a
simple witness for truth. Athanasius is the hero of a
mighty struggle, and the secret of his grandeur is his
intense and vivid faith that the incarnation is a real
revelation from the other world, and that its issues are
for life and death supreme in heaven and earth and
hell for evermore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Early years of
his rule at
Alexandria.</div>

<p>Such a bishop was sure to meet a bitter opposition,
and as sure to overcome it. Egypt soon became a
stronghold of the Nicene faith, for Athanasius
could sway the heart of Greek and Copt
alike. The pertinacious hatred of a few
was balanced by the enthusiastic admiration of the
many. The Meletians dwindled fast, the Arians faster
still. Nothing but outside persecution was needed now
to make Nicene orthodoxy the national faith of Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginnings of
the reaction.</div>

<p>It will be remembered that Eusebius of Nicomedia
was exiled shortly after the council. His disgrace was
not a long one. He had powerful friends
at court, and it was not very hard for a man
who had signed the creed to satisfy the Emperor of his
substantial orthodoxy. Constantine was not unforgiving,
and policy as well as easy temper forbade him to
scrutinize too closely the professions of submission laid
before him. Once restored to his former influence at
court, Eusebius became the centre of intrigue against
the council. Old Lucianic friendships may have led
him on. Arius was a Lucianist like himself, and the
Lucianists had in vain defended him before the council.
Eusebius was the ablest of them, and had fared the
worst. He had strained his conscience to sign the
creed, and his compliance had not even saved him from
exile. We cannot wonder if he brought back a firm
determination to undo the council's hateful work. If
it was too dangerous to attack the creed itself, its
defenders might be got rid of one by one on various
pretexts. Such was the plan of operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of
the Eusebian
coalition.</div>

<p>A party was easily formed. The Lucianists were its
nucleus, and all sorts of malcontents gathered round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
them. The Meletians of Egypt joined the coalition,
and the unclean creatures of the palace rejoiced to
hear of fresh intrigue. Above all, the conservatives
gave extensive help. The charges
against the Nicene leaders were often more
than plausible, for men like the C&aelig;sarean Eusebius
dreaded Sabellianism, and Marcellus was practically
Sabellian, and the others aiders and abettors of his
misbelief. Some even of the darker charges may have
had some ground, or at least have seemed truer than
they were. Thus Eusebius had a very heterogeneous
following, and it would be scant charity if we laid on
all of them the burden of their leader's infamy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attacks on:
(1.) Eustathius.</div>

<p>They began with Eustathius of Antioch, an old
confessor and a man of eloquence, who enjoyed a great
and lasting popularity in the city. He was
one of the foremost enemies of Arianism at
Nic&aelig;a, and had since waged an active literary war with
the Arianizing clique in Syria. In one respect they
found him a specially dangerous enemy, for he saw
clearly the important consequences of the Arian denial
of the Lord's true human soul. Eustathius was therefore
deposed (on obscure grounds) in 330, and exiled
with many of his clergy to Thrace. The vacant see
was offered to Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea, and finally accepted
by the Cappadocian Euphronius. But party spirit ran
high at Antioch. The removal of Eustathius nearly
caused a bloody riot, and his departure was followed
by an open schism. The Nicenes refused to recognise
Euphronius, and held their meetings apart, under the
presbyter Paulinus, remaining without a bishop for
more than thirty years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) Marcellus.</div>

<p>The system was vigorously followed up. Ten of the
Nicene leaders were exiled in the next year or two.
But Alexandria and Ancyra were the great
strongholds of the Nicene faith, and the
Eusebians still had to expel Marcellus and Athanasius.
As Athanasius might have met a charge of heresy with
a dangerous retort, it was found necessary to take other
methods with him. Marcellus, however, was so far the
foremost champion of the council, and he had fairly
exposed himself to a doctrinal attack. Let us therefore
glance at his theory of the incarnation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of
Marcellus.</div>

<p>Marcellus of Ancyra was already in middle life when
he came forward as a resolute enemy of Arianism at
Nic&aelig;a. Nothing is known of his early
years and education, but we can see some
things which influenced him later on. Ancyra was
a strange diocese, full of uncouth Gauls and chaffering
Jews, and overrun with Montanists and Manichees, and
votaries of endless fantastic heresies and superstitions.
In the midst of this turmoil Marcellus spent his life;
and if he learned too much of the Galatian party spirit,
he learned also that the gospel is wider than the forms
of Greek philosophy. The speculations of Alexandrian
theology were as little appreciated by the Celts of Asia
as is the stately churchmanship of England by the
Celts of Wales. They were the foreigner's thoughts,
too cold for Celtic zeal, too grand for Celtic narrowness.
Fickleness is not inconsistent with a true and
deep religious instinct, and we may find something
austere and high behind the ever-changing phases of
spiritual excitement. Thus the ideal holiness of the
church, upheld by Montanists and Novatians, attracted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
kindred spirits at opposite ends of the Empire, among
the Moors of the Atlas and the Gauls of Asia. Such
a people will have sins and scandals like its neighbours,
but very little indifference or cynicism. It will be
more inclined to make of Christian liberty an excuse
for strife and debate. The zeal which carries the
gospel to the loneliest mountain villages will also fill
them with the jealousies of endless quarrelling sects;
and the Gaul of Asia clung to his separatism with all
the more tenacity for the consciousness that his race
was fast dissolving in the broader and better world of
Greece. Thus Marcellus was essentially a stranger to
the wider movements of his time. His system is an
appeal from Origen to St. John, from philosophy to
Scripture. Nor can we doubt the high character and
earnest zeal of the man who for years stood side by
side with Athanasius. The more significant therefore
is the failure of his bold attempt to cut the knot of
controversy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doctrine of
Marcellus.</div>

<p>Marcellus then agreed with the Arians that the idea
of sonship implies beginning and inferiority, so that
a Son of God is neither eternal nor equal to
the Father. When the Arians argued on
both grounds that the Lord is a creature, the conservatives
were content to reply that the idea of sonship
excludes that of creation, and implies a peculiar
relation to and origin from the Father. But their own
position was weak. Whatever they might say, their
secondary God was a second God, and their theory
of the eternal generation only led them into further
difficulties, for their concession of the Son's origin from
the will of the Father made the Arian conclusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
irresistible. Marcellus looked scornfully on a lame
result like this. The conservatives had broken down
because they had gone astray after vain philosophy.
Turn we then to Scripture. 'In the beginning was,'
not the Son, but the Word. It is no secondary or
accidental title which St. John throws to the front of
his Gospel, and repeats with deliberate emphasis three
times over in the first verse. Thus the Lord is
properly the Word of God, and this must govern the
meaning of all such secondary names as the Son.
Then he is not only the silent thinking principle
which remains with God, but also the active creating
power which comes forth too for the dispensation of
the world. In this Sabellianizing sense Marcellus
accepted the Nicene faith, holding that the Word is
one with God as reason is one with man. Thus he
explained the Divine Sonship and other difficulties by
limiting them to the incarnation. The Word as such
is pure spirit, and only became the Son of God by
becoming the Son of Man. It was only in virtue of
this humiliating separation from the Father that the
Word acquired a sort of independent personality.
Thus the Lord was human certainly on account of
his descent into true created human flesh, and yet
not merely human, for the Word remained unchanged.
Not for its own sake was the Word incarnate, but
merely for the conquest of Satan. 'The flesh profiteth
nothing,' and even the gift of immortality cannot make
it worthy of permanent union with the Word. God is
higher than immortality itself, and even the immortal
angels cannot pass the gulf which parts the creature
from its Lord. That which is of the earth is useless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
for the age to come. Hence the human nature must
be laid aside when its work is done and every hostile
power overthrown. Then shall the Son of God deliver
up the kingdom to the Father, that the kingdom of
God may have no end; and then the Word shall
return, and be for ever with the Father as before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conservative
panic.</div>

<p>A universal cry of horror rose from the conservative
ranks to greet the new Sabellius, the Jew and worse
than Jew, the shameless miscreant who had
forsworn the Son of God. Marcellus had
confused together all the errors he could find. The
faith itself was at peril if blasphemies like these were
to be sheltered behind the rash decisions of Nic&aelig;a.
So thought the conservatives, and not without a reason,
though their panic was undignified from the first, and
became a positive calamity when taken up by political
adventurers for their own purposes. As far as doctrine
went, there was little to choose between Marcellus
and Arius. Each held firmly the central error of the
conservatives, and rejected as illogical the modifications
and side views by which they were finding their way
to something better. Both parties, says Athanasius,
are equally inconsistent. The conservatives, who refuse
eternal being to the Son of God, will not endure to
hear that his kingdom is other than eternal; while the
Marcellians, who deny his personality outright, are
equally shocked at the Arian limitation of it to the
sphere of time. Nor had Marcellus escaped the difficulties
of Arius. If, for example, the idea of an
eternal Son is polytheistic, nothing is gained by transferring
the eternity to an impersonal Word. If the
generation of the Son is materializing, so also is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
coming forth of the Word. If the work of creation is
unworthy of God, it may as well be delegated to a
created Son as to a transitory Word. So far Athanasius.
Indeed, to Marcellus the Son of God is a mere
phenomenon of time, and even the Word is as foreign
to the divine essence as the Arian Son. If the one
can only reveal in finite measure, the other gives but
broken hints of an infinity beyond. Instead of destroying
Arianism by the roots, Marcellus had fallen
into something very like Sabellianism. He reaches
no true mediation, no true union of God and man, for
he makes the incarnation a mere theophany, the flesh
a useless burden, to be one day laid aside. The Lord
is our Redeemer and the conqueror of death and Satan,
but there is no room for a second Adam, the organic
head of regenerate mankind. The redemption becomes
a mere intervention from without, not also the planting
of a power of life within, which will one day quicken
our mortal bodies too.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3.) Athanasius.</div>

<p>Marcellus had fairly exposed himself to a doctrinal
attack; other methods were used with Athanasius.
They had material enough without touching
doctrine. His election was disputed:
Meletians and Arians complained of oppression: there
were some useful charges of magic and political intrigue.
At first, however, the Meletians could not
even get a hearing from the Emperor. When Eusebius
of Nicomedia took up their cause, they fared a little
better. The attack had to be put off till the winter
of 331, and was even then a failure. Their charges
were partly answered by two presbyters of Athanasius
who were on the spot; and when the bishop himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
was summoned to court, he soon completed their discomfiture.
As Constantine was now occupied with the
Gothic war, nothing more could be done till 334.
When, however, Athanasius was ordered to attend a
council at C&aelig;sarea, he treated it as a mere cabal of his
enemies, and refused to appear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Council of
Tyre (335).</div>

<p>Next year the Eastern bishops gathered to Jerusalem
to keep the festival of the thirtieth year of Constantine's
reign and to dedicate his splendid church
on Golgotha. But first it was a work of
charity to restore peace in Egypt. A synod of about
150 bishops was held at Tyre, and this time the
appearance of Athanasius was secured by peremptory
orders from the Emperor. The Eusebians had the
upper hand, though there was a strong minority.
Athanasius brought nearly fifty bishops from Egypt,
and others, like Maximus of Jerusalem and Alexander
of Thessalonica, were willing to do justice. Athanasius
was not accused of heresy, but, with more plausibility,
of episcopal tyranny. His friends replied with reckless
violence. Potammon aimed a bitter and unrighteous
taunt at Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea. 'You and I were once
in prison for the faith. I lost an eye: how did you
escape?' Athanasius might perhaps have been crushed
if his enemies had kept up a decent semblance of
truth and fairness. But nothing was further from
their thoughts than an impartial trial. Scandal succeeded
scandal, till the iniquity culminated in the
dispatch of an openly partizan commission to superintend
the manufacture of evidence in Egypt. Maximus
of Jerusalem and Paphnutius left the council, saying
that it was not good that old confessors like them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
should share its evil deeds. The Egyptian bishops
protested. Alexander of Thessalonica denounced the
plot to the Emperor's representative. Athanasius himself
took ship for Constantinople without waiting for
the end of the farce, and the council condemned him
by default. This done, the bishops went on to Jerusalem
for the proper business of their meeting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assembly at
Jerusalem.</div>

<p>The concourse on Golgotha was a brilliant spectacle.
Ten years had passed since the still unrivalled assembly
at Nic&aelig;a, and the veterans of the last
great persecution must have been deeply
moved at their meeting once again in this world.
The stately ceremonial suited Maximus and Eusebius
much better than the noisy scene at Tyre, and may
for the moment have soothed the swelling indignation
of Potammon and Paphnutius. Constantine had once
more plastered over the divisions of the churches with
a general reconciliation, but this time Athanasius
was condemned and Arius received to communion.
The heretic had long since left his exile in Illyricum,
though we cannot fix the date of his recall. However,
one winter the Emperor invited Arius and his friend
Euzoius to Constantinople, where they laid before him
a short and simple confession of their faith. It said
nothing of the disputed points, but was not unorthodox
as far as it went. Nor were they bishops, that the
Nicene creed should be forced upon them. Constantine
was therefore satisfied, and now directed them to lay
it before the bishops at Jerusalem, who duly approved
of it and received its authors to communion. In order
to complete the work of peace, Athanasius was condemned
afresh on the return of the commission from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Egypt, and proceedings were begun against Marcellus
of Ancyra.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First exile of
Athanasius.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Constantine's dreams of peace were rudely
dissipated by the sudden appearance of Athanasius
before him in the streets of Constantinople.
Whatever the bishops had done, they had
plainly caused dissensions just when the Emperor was
most anxious for harmony. An angry letter summoned
the whole assembly straight to court. The meeting,
however, was most likely dispersed before its arrival;
at any rate, there came only a deputation of Eusebians.
The result was unexpected. Instead of attempting to
defend the council of Tyre, Eusebius of Nicomedia
suddenly accused Athanasius of hindering the supply
of corn for the capital. This was quite a new charge,
and chosen with much skill. Athanasius was not
allowed to defend himself, but summarily sent away to
Trier in Gaul, where he was honourably received by
the younger Constantine. On the other hand, the
Emperor refused to let his place be filled up at
Alexandria, and exiled the Meletian leader, John
Archaph, 'for causing divisions.' To Constantinople
came also Marcellus. He had kept away from the
councils of Tyre and Jerusalem, and only came now to
invite the Emperor's decision on his book. Constantine
referred it as usual to the bishops, who promptly condemned
it and deposed its author.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Arius.</div>

<p>There remained only the formal restoration of Arius
to communion at Constantinople. But the heretic was
taken ill suddenly, and died in the midst
of a procession the evening before the day
appointed. His enemies saw in his death a judgment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
from heaven, and likened it to that of Judas. Only
Athanasius relates it with reserve and dignity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Policy of
Constantine.</div>

<p>Upon the whole, Constantine had done his best for
peace by leaving matters in an uneasy suspense which
satisfied neither party. This seems the
best explanation of his wavering. He had
not turned Arian, for there is no sign that he ever
allowed the decisions of Nic&aelig;a to be openly rejected
inside the churches. Athanasius was not exiled for
heresy, for there was no question of heresy in the case.
The quarrel was ostensibly one of orthodox bishops, for
Eusebius had signed the Nicene creed as well as
Athanasius. Constantine's action seems to have been
determined by Asiatic feeling. Had he believed the
charge of delaying the corn-ships, he would have executed
Athanasius at once. His conduct does not look
like a real explosion of rage. The merits of the case
were not easy to find out, but the quarrel between
Athanasius and the Asiatic bishops was a nuisance, so
he sent him out of the way as a troublesome person.
The Asiatics were not all of them either Arians or
intriguers. It was not always furtive sympathy with
heresy which led them to regret the heresiarch's
expulsion for doctrines which he disavowed; neither
was it always partizanship which could not see the
innocence of Athanasius. Constantine's vacillation is
natural if his policy was to seek for unity by letting
the bishops guide him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3><i>THE COUNCIL OF SARDICA.</i></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Death of
Constantine,
May 22, 337.</div>

<p>Constantine's work on earth was done. When the
hand of death was on him, he laid aside the purple,
and the ambiguous position of a Christian
C&aelig;sar with it, and passed away in the white
robe of a simple convert. Long as he had
been a friend to the churches, he had till now put off
the elementary rite of baptism, in the hope one day to
receive it in the waters of the Jordan, like the Lord
himself. Darkly as his memory is stained with isolated
crimes, Constantine must for ever rank among the
greatest of the emperors; and as an actual benefactor
of mankind, he stands alone among them. Besides
his great services to the Empire in his own time, he
gave the civilization of later days a new centre on the
Bosphorus, beyond the reach of Goth or Vandal.
Bulgarians and Saracens and Russians dashed themselves
in pieces on the walls of Constantinople,
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1204.) and the strong arms of Western and crusading traitors were
needed at last to overthrow the old bulwark
which for so many centuries had guarded
Christendom. Above all, it was Constantine who first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
essayed the problem of putting a Christian spirit into
the statecraft of the world. Hard as the task is even
now, it was harder still in times when the gospel had
not yet had time to form, as it were, an outwork of
common feeling against some of the grosser sins. Yet
whatever might be his errors, his legislation was a
landmark for ever, because no emperor before him had
been guided by a Christian sense of duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Division of
the Empire.</div>

<p>The sons of Constantine shared the Empire among
them 'like an ancestral inheritance.' Thrace and Pontus
had been assigned to their cousins, Dalmatius
and Hannibalianus; but the army would
have none but Constantine's own sons to reign over
them. The whole house of Theodora perished in the
tumult except two boys&mdash;Gallus and Julian, afterwards
the apostate Emperor. Thus Constantine's sons were
left in possession of the Empire. Constantine II. took
Gaul and Britain, the legions of Syria secured the East
for Constantius, and Italy and Illyricum were left for
the share of the youngest, Constans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recall of Athanasius,
337.</div>

<p>One of the first acts of the new Emperors was to
restore the exiled bishops. Athanasius was released
by the younger Constantine as soon as his
father's death was known at Trier, and
reached Alexandria in November 337, to the joy of
both Greeks and Copts. Marcellus and the rest were
restored about the same time, though not without much
disturbance at Ancyra, where the intruding bishop
Basil was an able man, and had formed a party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of
Constantius.</div>

<p>Let us now take a glance at the new Emperor of the
East. Constantius had something of his father's
character. In temperance and chastity, in love of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
letters and in dignity of manner, in social charm and
pleasantness of private life, he was no unworthy son of
Constantine; and if he inherited no splendid
genius for war, he had a full measure of
soldierly courage and endurance. Nor was the statesmanship
entirely bad which kept the East in tolerable
peace for four-and-twenty years. But Constantius was
essentially a little man, in whom his father's vices took
a meaner form. Constantine committed some great
crimes, but the whole spirit of Constantius was
corroded with fear and jealousy of every man better
than himself. Thus the easy trust in unworthy
favourites, which marks even the ablest of his family,
became in Constantius a public calamity. It was bad
enough when the uprightness of Constantine or Julian
was led astray, but it was far worse when the
eunuchs found a master too weak to stand alone, too
jealous to endure a faithful counsellor, too easy-tempered
and too indolent to care what oppressions
were committed in his name, and without the sense of
duty which would have gone far to make up for all
his shortcomings. The peculiar repulsiveness of Constantius
is not due to any flagrant personal vice, but
to the combination of cold-blooded treachery with the
utter want of any inner nobleness of character. Yet
he was a pious emperor, too, in his own way. He
loved the ecclesiastical game, and was easily won over
to the Eusebian side. The growing despotism of the
Empire and the personal vanity of Constantius were
equally suited by the episcopal timidity which cried
for an arm of flesh to fight its battles. It is not easy
to decide how far he acted on his own likings and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
superstitions, how far he merely let his flatterers lead
him, or how far he saw political reasons for following
them. In any case, he began with a thorough dislike
of the Nicene council, continued for a long time to
hold conservative language, and ended after some
vacillation by adopting the vague Homo&oelig;n compromise
of 359.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second exile of
Athanasius,
Lent, 339.</div>

<p>Eusebian intrigue was soon resumed. Now that
Constantine was dead, a schism could be set on foot at
Alexandria; so the Arians were encouraged
to hold assemblies of their own, and provided
with a bishop in the person of Pistus,
one of the original heretics deposed by Alexander.
No fitter consecrator could be found for him than
Secundus of Ptolemais, one of the two bishops who
held out to the last against the council. The next
move was the formal deposition of Athanasius by a
council held at Antioch in the winter of 338. But
there was still no charge of heresy&mdash;only old and new
ones of sedition and intrigue, and a new argument,
that after his deposition at Tyre he had forfeited all
right to further justice by accepting a restoration from
the civil power. This last was quite a new claim on
behalf of the church, first used against Athanasius, and
next afterwards for the ruin of Chrysostom, though it
has since been made a pillar of the faith. Pistus was
not appointed to the vacant see. The council chose
Gregory of Cappadocia as a better agent for the rough
work to be done. Athanasius was expelled by the
apostate prefect Philagrius, and Gregory installed by
military violence in his place. Scenes of outrage were
enacted all over Egypt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Athanasius and
Marcellus at
Rome.</div>

<p>Athanasius fled to Rome. Thither also came Marcellus
of Ancyra, and ejected clerics from all parts of
the East. Under the rule of Constans they
might meet with justice. Bishop Julius
at once took the position of an arbiter of
Christendom. He received the fugitives with a decent
reserve, and invited the Eusebians to the council they
had already asked him to hold. For a long time there
came no answer from the East. The old heretic
Carpones appeared at Rome on Gregory's behalf, but
the envoys of Julius were detained at Antioch till
January 340, and at last dismissed with an unmannerly
reply. After some further delay, a synod of about
fifty bishops met at Rome the following autumn. The
cases were examined, Marcellus and Athanasius acquitted,
and it remained for Julius to report their decision
to the Easterns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The letter of
Julius.</div>

<p>His letter is one of the ablest documents of the
entire controversy. Nothing can be better than the
calm and high judicial tone in which he
lays open every excuse of the Eusebians.
He was surprised, he says, to receive so discourteous
an answer to his letter. But what was their
grievance? If it was his invitation to a synod,
they could not have much confidence in their cause.
Even the great council of Nic&aelig;a had decided (and not
without the will of God) that the acts of one synod
might be revised by another. Their own envoys had
asked him to hold a council, and the men who set
aside the decisions of Nic&aelig;a by using the services of
heretics like Secundus, Pistus and Carpones could
hardly claim finality for their own doings at Tyre.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Their complaint that he had given them too short a
notice would have been reasonable if the appointed day
had found them on the road to Rome. 'But this
also, beloved, is only an excuse.' They had detained
his envoys for months at Antioch, and plainly did not
mean to come. As for the reception of Athanasius, it
was neither lightly nor unjustly done. The Eusebian
letters against him were inconsistent, for no two of
them ever told the same story; and they were, moreover,
contradicted by letters in his favour from Egypt
and elsewhere. The accused had come to Rome when
summoned, and waited for them eighteen months in
vain, whereas the Eusebians had uncanonically appointed
an utter stranger in his place at Alexandria,
and sent him with a guard of soldiers all the way from
Antioch to disturb the peace of Egypt with horrible
outrages. With regard to Marcellus, he had denied
the charge of heresy and presented a very sound confession
of his faith. The Roman legates at Nic&aelig;a
had also borne witness to the honourable part he had
taken in the council. Thus the Eusebians could not
say that Athanasius and Marcellus had been too hastily
received at Rome. Rather their own doings were the
cause of all the troubles, for complaints of their violence
came in from all parts of the East. The authors of
these outrages were no lovers of peace, but of confusion.
Whatever grievance they might have against
Athanasius, they should not have neglected the old
custom of writing first to Rome, that a legitimate
decision might issue from the apostolic see. It was
time to put an end to these scandals, as they would
have to answer for them in the day of judgment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticism of it.</div>

<p>Severe as the letter is, it contrasts well with the
disingenuous querulousness of the Eusebians. Nor is
Julius unmindful to press as far as possible
the claims of the Roman see. His one
serious mistake was in supporting Marcellus. No
doubt old services at Nic&aelig;a counted heavily in the
West. His confession too was innocent enough, being
very nearly our so-called Apostles' Creed, here met for
the first time in history.<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Knowing, however, what
his doctrine was, we must admit that the Easterns
were right in resenting its deliberate approval at
Rome.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_12" id="Footnote_1_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_12"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It has even been ascribed to Marcellus; but it seems a little older.
Its apostolic origin is of course absurd. The legend cannot be traced
beyond the last quarter of the fourth century.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Council of the
dedication at
Antioch (341).</div>

<p>The Eusebians replied in the summer of 341,
when ninety bishops met at Antioch to consecrate
the Golden Church, begun by Constantine.
The character of the council is an old
question of dispute. Hilary calls it a
meeting of saints, and its canons have found their
way into the authoritative collections; yet its chief
work was to confirm the deposition of Athanasius and
to draw up creeds in opposition to the Nicene. Was
it Nicene or Arian? Probably neither, but conservative.
The Eusebians seem to have imitated Athanasius
in pressing a creed (this time an Arianizing one) on
unwilling conservatives, but only to have succeeded in
making great confusion. This was a new turn of
their policy, and not a hopeful one. Constantine's
death indeed left them free to try if they could replace
the Nicene creed by something else; but the friends of
Athanasius could accept no substitute, and even the
conservatives could hardly agree to make the Lord's
divinity an open question. The result was twenty
years of busy creed-making, and twenty more of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>confusion,
before it was finally seen that there was no
escape from the dilemma which had been decisive at
Nic&aelig;a.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lucianic
creed (second
of Antioch).</div>

<p>The Eusebians began by offering a meagre and
evasive creed, much like the confession of Arius and
Euzoius, prefacing it with a declaration
that they were not followers of Arius, but
his independent adherents. They overshot
their mark, for the conservatives were not willing to
go so far as this, and, moreover, had older standards
of their own. Instead, therefore, of drawing up a new
creed, they put forward a work of the venerated
martyr Lucian of Antioch. Such it was said to be,
and such in the main it probably was, though the
anathemas must have been added now. This Lucianic
formula then is essentially conservative, but leans
much more to the Nicene than to the Arian side.
Its central clause declares the Son of God 'not
subject to moral change or alteration, but the unvarying
image of the deity and essence and power
and counsel and glory of the Father,' while its
anathemas condemn 'those who say that there was
once <i>a time</i> when the Son of God was not, or that
he is a creature <i>as one of the creatures</i>.' These are
strong words, but they do not in the least shut out
Arianism. No doubt the phrase 'unvarying image
of the essence' means that there is no change of
essence in passing from the Father to the Son, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
is therefore logically equivalent to 'of one essence'
(<i>homoousion</i>); but the conservatives meant nothing
more than 'of like essence' (<i>homoiousion</i>), which is
consistent with great unlikeness in attributes. The
anathemas also are the Nicene with insertions which
might have been made for the very purpose of letting
the Arians escape. However, the conservatives were
well satisfied with the Lucianic creed, and frequently
refer to it with a veneration akin to that of Athanasius
for the Nicene. But the wire-pullers were determined
to upset it. The confession next presented by Theophronius
of Tyana was more to their mind, for it
contained a direct anathema against "Marcellus and
those who communicated with him." It secured a
momentary approval, but the meeting broke up without
adopting it. The Lucianic formula remained the
creed of the council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fourth
creed.</div>

<p>Defeated in a free council, the wire-pullers a few
months later assembled a cabal of their own, and
drew up a fourth creed, which a deputation
of notorious Arianizers presented to Constans
in Gaul as the genuine work of the council.
It seems to have suited them better than the Lucianic,
for they repeated it with increasing series of anathemas
at Philippopolis in 343, at Antioch the next year,
and at Sirmium in 351. We can see why it suited
them. While in substance it is less opposed to
Arianism than the Lucianic, its wording follows the
Nicene, even to the adoption of the anathemas in a
weakened form. Upon the whole, it is a colourless
document, which left all questions open.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Constans
demands a
council.</div>

<p>The wording of the creed of Tyana was a direct blow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
at Julius of Rome, and is of itself enough to show
that its authors were no lovers of peace. But Western
suspicion was already roused by the issue
of the Lucianic creed. There could no
longer be any doubt that the Nicene faith
was the real object of attack. Before the Eastern
envoys reached Constans in Gaul, he had already
written to his brother (Constantine II. was now dead)
to demand a new general council. Constantius was
busy with the Persian war, and could not refuse;
so it was summoned to meet in the summer of 343.
To the dismay of the Eusebians, the place chosen
was Sardica in Dacia, just inside the dominions of
Constans. After their failure with the Eastern
bishops at Antioch, they could not hope to control
the Westerns in a free council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Council of
Sardica (343).</div>

<p>To Sardica the bishops came. The Westerns were
about ninety-six in number, 'with Hosius of Cordova
for their father,' bringing with him Athanasius
and Marcellus, and supported by the
chief Westerns&mdash;Gratus of Carthage, Protasius of
Milan, Maximus of Trier, Fortunatian of Aquileia, and
Vincent of Capua, the old Roman legate at Nic&aelig;a.
The Easterns, under Stephen of Antioch and Acacius
of C&aelig;sarea, the disciple and successor of Eusebius,
were for once outnumbered. They therefore travelled
in one body, more than seventy strong, and agreed
to act together. They began by insisting that the
deposition of Marcellus and Athanasius at Antioch
should be accepted without discussion. Such a
demand was absurd. There was no reason why the
deposition at Antioch should be accepted blindly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
rather than the acquittal at Rome. At any rate, the
council had an express commission to re-open the
whole case, and indeed had met for no other purpose;
so, if they were not to do it, they might as well go
home. The Westerns were determined to sift the
whole matter to the bottom, but the Eusebians
refused to enter the council. It was in vain that
Hosius asked them to give their proofs, if it were
only to himself in private. In vain he promised
that if Athanasius was acquitted, and they were
still unwilling to receive him, he would take him
back with him to Spain. The Westerns began the
trial: the Easterns left Sardica by night in haste.
They had heard, forsooth, of a victory on the Persian
frontier, and must pay their respects to the Emperor
without a moment's delay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Acquittal of
Marcellus and
Athanasius.</div>

<p>Once more the charges were examined and the
accused acquitted. In the case of Marcellus, it was
found that the Eusebians had misquoted
his book, setting down opinions as his own
which he had only put forward for discussion.
Thus it was not true that he had denied
the eternity of the Word in the past or of his kingdom
in the future. Quite so: but the eternity of the
Sonship is another matter. This was the real charge
against him, and he was allowed to evade it. Though
doctrinal questions lay more in the background in the
case of Athanasius, one party in the council was for
issuing a new creed in explanation of the Nicene. The
proposal was wisely rejected. It would have made
the fatal admission that Arianism had not been clearly
condemned at Nic&aelig;a, and thrown on the Westerns the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
odium of innovation. All that could be done was to
pass a series of canons to check the worst scandals of
late years. After this the council issued its encyclical
and the bishops dispersed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Easterns (such was their haste)
halted for some weeks at Philippopolis to issue their
own encyclical, falsely dating it from Sardica.
They begin with their main argument,
that the acts of councils are irreversible.
Next they recite the charges against Athanasius
and Marcellus, and the doings of the Westerns
at Sardica. Hereupon they denounce Hosius, Julius,
and others as associates of heretics and patrons of
the detestable errors of Marcellus. A few random
charges of gross immorality are added, after the
Eusebian custom. They end with a new creed, the
fourth of Antioch, with some verbal changes, and
seven anathemas instead of two.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fifth
creed of
Antioch
(344).</div>

<p>The quarrel of East and West seemed worse than
ever. The Eusebians had behaved discreditably
enough, but they had at least frustrated
the council, and secured a recognition of
their creed from a large body of Eastern
conservatives. So far they had been fairly successful,
but the next move on their side was a blunder and
worse. When the Sardican envoys, Vincent of Capua
and Euphrates of Cologne, came eastward in the spring
of 344, a harlot was brought one night into their
lodgings. Great was the scandal when the plot was
traced up to the Eusebian leader, Stephen of Antioch.
A new council was held, by which Stephen was deposed
and Leontius the Lucianist, himself the subject of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
old scandal, was raised to the vacant see. The fourth
creed of Antioch was also re-issued with a few changes,
but followed by long paragraphs of explanation. The
Easterns adhered to their condemnation of Marcellus,
and joined with him his disciple Photinus of Sirmium,
who had made the Lord a mere man like the Ebionites.
On the other hand, they condemned several Arian
phrases, and insisted in the strongest manner on the
mutual, inseparable, and, as it were, organic union of
the Son with the Father in a single deity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of
Athanasius
(Oct. 346).</div>

<p>This conciliatory move cleared the way for a general
suspension of hostilities. Stephen's crime had discredited
the whole gang of Eastern court
intriguers who had made the quarrel. Nor
were the Westerns unreasonable. Though
they still upheld Marcellus, they frankly gave up and
condemned Photinus. Meanwhile Constans pressed the
execution of the decrees of Sardica, and Constantius,
with a Persian war on his hands, could not refuse.
The last obstacle was removed by the death of Gregory
of Cappadocia in 345. It was not till the third invitation
that Athanasius returned. He had to take
leave of his Italian friends, and the Emperor's letters
were only too plainly insincere. However, Constantius
received him graciously at Antioch, ordered all the
charges against him to be destroyed, and gave him
a solemn promise of full protection for the future.
Athanasius went forward on his journey, and the old
confessor Maximus assembled the bishops of Palestine
to greet him at Jerusalem. But his entry into Alexandria
(Oct. 346) was the crowning triumph of his life.
For miles along the road the great city streamed out to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
meet him with enthusiastic welcome, and the jealous
police of Constantius could raise no tumult to mar the
universal harmony of that great day of national rejoicing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interval of
rest (346-353.)</div>

<p>The next few years were an uneasy interval of suspense
rather than of peace, for the long contest had so
far decided nothing. If the Nicene exiles
were restored, the Eusebian disturbers were
not deposed. Thus while Nicene animosity was not
satisfied, the standing grounds of conservative distrust
were not removed. Above all, the return of Athanasius
was a personal humiliation for Constantius, which
he was not likely to accept without watching his opportunity
for a final struggle to decide the mastery of
Egypt. Still there was tolerable quiet for the present.
The court intriguers could do nothing without the
Emperor, and Constantius was occupied first with the
Persian war, then with the civil war against Magnentius.
If there was not peace, there was a fair amount of quiet
till the Emperor's hands were freed by the death of
Magnentius in 353.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modification
of Nicene
position.</div>

<p>The truce was hollow and the rest precarious, but
the mere cessation of hostilities was not without its
influence. As Nicenes and conservatives
were fundamentally agreed on the reality of
the Lord's divinity, minor jealousies began
to disappear when they were less busily encouraged.
The Eusebian phase of conservatism, which emphasised
the Lord's personal distinction from the Father, was
giving way to the Semiarian, where stress was rather
laid on his essential likeness to the Father. Thus 'of
a like essence' (<i>homoiousion</i>) and 'like in all things'
became more and more the watchwords of conservatism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The Nicenes, on the other side, were warned by the
excesses of Marcellus that there was some reason for
the conservative dread of the Nicene 'of one essence'
(<i>homoousion</i>) as Sabellian. The word could not be
withdrawn, but it might be put forward less conspicuously,
and explained rather as a safe and emphatic
form of the Semiarian 'of like essence' than as a rival
doctrine. Henceforth it came to mean absolute likeness
of attributes rather than common possession of the
divine essence. Thus by the time the war is renewed,
we can already foresee the possibility of a new alliance
between Nicenes and conservatives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of
Anom&oelig;ans.</div>

<p>We see also the rise of a new and more defiant Arian
school, more in earnest than the older generation,
impatient of their shuffling diplomacy and
less pliant to court influences. Aetius was
a man of learning and no small dialectic skill, who had
passed through many troubles in his earlier life and
been the disciple of several scholars, mostly of the
Lucianic school, before he came to rest in a clear and
simple form of Arianism. Christianity without mystery
seems to have been his aim. The Anom&oelig;an leaders
took their stand on the doctrine of Arius himself, and
dwelt with most emphasis on its most offensive aspects.
Arius had long ago laid down the absolute unlikeness
of the Son to the Father, but for years past the
Arianizers had prudently softened it down. Now, however,
'unlike' became the watchword of Aetius and
Eunomius, and their followers delighted to shock all
sober feeling by the harshest and profanest declarations
of it. The scandalous jests of Eudoxius must have
given deep offence to thousands; but the great novelty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of the Anom&oelig;an doctrine was its audacious self-sufficiency.
Seeing that Arius was illogical in regarding
the divine nature as incomprehensible, and yet reasoning
as if its relations were fully explained by human
types, the Anom&oelig;ans boldly declared that it is no
mystery at all. If the divine essence is simple, man
can perfectly understand it. 'Canst thou by searching
find out God?' Yes, and know him quite as well as
he knows me. Such was the new school of Arianism&mdash;presumptuous
and shallow, quarrelsome and heathenising,
yet not without a directness and a firmness of conviction
which gives it a certain dignity in spite of its
wrangling and irreverence. Its conservative allies it
despised for their wavering and insincerity; to its
Nicene opponents it repaid hatred for hatred, and flung
back with retorted scorn their denial of its right to
bear the Christian name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustration
from the state
of: (1.) Jerusalem.</div>

<p>We may now glance at the state of the churches
at Jerusalem and Antioch during the years of rest.
Jerusalem had been a resort of pilgrims
since the days of Origen, and Helena's
visit shortly after the Nicene council had
fully restored it to the dignity of a holy place. We
still have the itinerary of a nameless pilgrim who
found his way from Bordeaux to Palestine in 333.
The great church, however, of the Resurrection, which
Constantine built on Golgotha, was only dedicated by
the council of 335. The <i>Catecheses</i> of Cyril are a
series of sermons on the creed, delivered to the catechumens
of that church in 348. If it is not a work
of any great originality, it will show us all the better
what was passing in the minds of men of practical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and simple piety, who had no taste for the controversies
of the day. All through it we see the earnest
pastor who feels that his strength is needed to combat
the practical immoralities of a holy city (Jerusalem
was a scandal of the age), and never lifts his eyes to
the wild scene of theological confusion round him but
in fear and dread that Antichrist is near. 'I fear the
wars of the nations; I fear the divisions of the
churches; I fear the mutual hatred of the brethren.
Enough concerning this. God forbid it come to pass in
our days; yet let us be on our guard. Enough concerning
Antichrist.' Jews, Samaritans, and Manichees
are his chief opponents; yet he does not forget to
warn his hearers against the teaching of Sabellius and
Marcellus, 'the dragon's head of late arisen in Galatia.'
Arius he sometimes contradicts in set terms, though
without naming him. Of the Nicenes too, we hear
nothing directly, but they seem glanced at in the
complaint that whereas in former times heresy was
open, the church is now full of secret heretics. The
Nicene creed again he never mentions, but we cannot
mistake the allusion when he tells his hearers that
their own Jerusalem creed was not put together by
the will of men, and impresses on them that every
word of it can be proved by Scripture. But the most
significant feature of his language is its close relation
to that of the dated creed of Sirmium in 359. Nearly
every point where the latter differs from the Lucianic
is one specially emphasized by Cyril. If then the
Lucianic creed represents the earlier conservatism, it
follows that Cyril expresses the later views which had
to be conciliated in 359.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) Antioch.</div>

<p>The condition of Antioch under Leontius (344-357)
is equally significant. The Nicene was quite as strong
in the city as Arianism had ever been at Alexandria.
The Eustathians formed a separate
and strongly Nicene congregation under the presbyter
Paulinus, and held their meetings outside the walls.
Athanasius communicated with them on his return
from exile, and agreed to give the Arians a church
in Alexandria, as Constantius desired, if only the
Eustathians were allowed one inside the walls of
Antioch. His terms were prudently declined, for the
Arians were a minority even in the congregation of
Leontius. The old Arian needed all his caution to
avoid offence. 'When this snow melts,' touching his
white head, 'there will be much mud.' Nicenes and
Arians made a slight difference in the doxology; and
Leontius always dropped his voice at the critical point,
so that nobody knew what he said. This policy was
successful in keeping out of the Eustathian communion
not only the indifferent multitude, but also many whose
sympathies were clearly Nicene, like the future bishops
Meletius and Flavian. But they always considered
him an enemy, and the more dangerous for the contrast
of his moderation with the reckless violence of Macedonius
at Constantinople. His appointments were
Arianizing, and he gave deep offence by the ordination
of his old disciple, the detested Aetius. So great was
the outcry that Leontius was forced to suspend him.
The opposition was led by two ascetic laymen, Flavian
and Diodorus, who both became distinguished bishops
in later time. Orthodox feeling was nourished by a
vigorous use of hymns and by all-night services at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
tombs of the martyrs. As such practices often led to
great abuses, Leontius may have had nothing more in
view than good order when he directed the services to
be transferred to the church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of
parties.</div>

<p>The case of Antioch was not exceptional. Arians
and Nicenes were still parties inside the church rather
than distant sects. They still used the
same prayers and the same hymns, still
worshipped in the same buildings, still commemorated
the same saints and martyrs, and still considered
themselves members of the same church. The
example of separation set by the Eustathians at Antioch
and the Arians at Alexandria was not followed till a
later stage of the controversy, when Diodorus and
Flavian on one side, and the Anom&oelig;ans on the other,
began to introduce their own peculiarities into the
service. And if the bitterness of intestine strife was
increased by a state of things which made every bishop
a party nominee, there was some compensation in the
free intercourse of parties afterwards separated by
barriers of persecution. Nicenes and Arians in most
places mingled freely long after Leontius was dead,
and the Novatians of Constantinople threw open their
churches to the victims of Macedonius in a way which
drew his persecution on themselves, and was remembered
in their favour even in the next century by
liberal men like the historian Socrates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>THE VICTORY OF ARIANISM</i>.</h3>


<div class="sidenote">The West
(337-350).</div>

<p>Meanwhile new troubles were gathering in the West.
While the Eastern churches were distracted with the
crimes or wrongs of Marcellus and Athanasius,
Europe remained at peace from the
Atlantic to the frontier of Thrace. The western
frontier of Constantius was also the western limit of
the storm. Hitherto its distant echoes had been very
faintly heard in Gaul and Spain; but now the time
was come for Arianism to invade the tranquil obscurity
of the West.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magnentian
war, 350-353.</div>

<p>Constans was not ill-disposed, and for some years
ruled well and firmly. Afterwards&mdash;it may be that
his health was bad&mdash;he lived in seclusion
with his Frankish guards, and left his subjects
to the oppression of unworthy favourites. Few
regretted their weak master's fate when the army of
Gaul proclaimed Magnentius Augustus (January 350).
But the memory of Constantine was still a power
which could set up emperors and pull them down.
The old general Vetranio at Sirmium received the
purple from Constantine's daughter, and Nepotianus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
claimed it at Rome as Constantine's nephew. The
Magnentian generals scattered the gladiators of Nepotianus,
and disgraced their easy victory with slaughter
and proscription. The ancient mother of the nations
never forgave the intruder who had disturbed her
queenly rest with civil war and filled her streets with
bloodshed. Meantime Constantius came up from Syria,
won over the legions of Illyricum, reduced Vetranio to
a peaceful abdication, and pushed on with augmented
forces towards the Julian Alps, there to decide the
strife between Magnentius and the house of Constantine.
Both parties tried the resources of intrigue; but while
Constantius won over the Frank Silvanus from the
Western camp, the envoys of Magnentius, who sounded
Athanasius, gained nothing from the wary Greek.
The decisive battle was fought near Mursa, on the
Save (September 28, 351). Both armies well sustained
the honour of the Roman name, and it was
only after a frightful slaughter that the usurper was
thrown back on Aquileia. Next summer he was
forced to evacuate Italy, and in 353 his destruction
was completed by a defeat in the Cottian Alps. Magnentius
fell upon his sword, and Constantius remained
the master of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewal of the
contest.</div>

<p>The Eusebians were not slow to take advantage of
the confusion. The fires of controversy in the East
were smouldering through the years of rest,
so that it was no hard task to make them
blaze afresh. As the recall of the exiles was only due
to Western pressure, the death of Constans cleared the
way for further operations. Marcellus and Photinus
were again deposed by a council held at Sirmium in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
351. Ancyra was restored to Basil, Sirmium given
to Germinius of Cyzicus. Other Eastern bishops were
also expelled, but there was no thought of disturbing
Athanasius for the present. Constantius more than
once repeated to him his promise of protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Western
bishops.</div>

<p>Magnentius had not meddled with the controversy.
He was more likely to see in it the chance of an ally
at Alexandria than a matter of practical
interest in the West. As soon, however,
as Constantius was master of Gaul, he set himself to
force on the Westerns an indirect condemnation of the
Nicene faith in the person of Athanasius. Any direct
approval of Arianism was out of the question, for
Western feeling was firmly set against it by the council
of Nic&aelig;a. Liberius of Rome followed the steps of
his predecessor Julius. Hosius of Cordova was still
the patriarch of Christendom, while Paulinus of Trier,
Dionysius of Milan, and Hilary of Poitiers proved their
faith in exile. Mere creatures of the palace were no
match for men like these. Doctrine was therefore
kept in the background. Constantius began by demanding
from the Western bishops a summary and
lawless condemnation of Athanasius. No evidence
was offered; and when an accuser was asked for, the
Emperor himself came forward, and this at a time
when Athanasius was ruling Alexandria in peace on
the faith of his solemn and repeated promises of protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Council of
Arles (Oct.
353).</div>

<p>A synod was held at Arles as soon as Constantius
was settled there for the winter. The bishops were
not unwilling to take the Emperor's word for the
crimes of Athanasius, if only the court party cleared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
itself from the suspicion of heresy by anathematizing
Arianism. Much management and no little violence
was needed to get rid of this condition;
but in the end the council yielded. Even
the Roman legate, Vincent of Capua, gave
way with the rest, and Paulinus of Trier alone stood
firm, and was sent away to die in exile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Council of
Milan (Oct.
355).</div>

<p>There was a sort of armed truce for the next two
years. Liberius of Rome disowned the weakness of
his legates and besought the Emperor to
hold a new council. But Constantius was
busy with the barbarians, and had to leave
the matter till he came to Milan in the autumn of
355. There Julian was invested with the purple and
sent as C&aelig;sar to drive the Alemanni out of Gaul, or,
as some hoped, to perish in the effort. The council,
however, was for a long time quite unmanageable, and
only yielded at last to open violence. Dionysius of
Milan, Eusebius of Vercell&aelig;, and Lucifer of Calaris in
Sardinia were the only bishops who had to be exiled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lucifer of
Calaris.</div>

<p>The appearance of Lucifer is enough to show that
the contest had entered on a new stage. The lawless
tyranny of Constantius had roused an
aggressive fanaticism which went far beyond
the claim of independence for the church. In dauntless
courage and determined orthodoxy Lucifer may
rival Athanasius himself, but any cause would have been
disgraced by his narrow partisanship and outrageous
violence. Not a bad name in Scripture but is turned
to use. Indignation every now and then supplies the
place of eloquence, but more often common sense itself
is almost lost in the weary flow of vulgar scolding and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
interminable abuse. He scarcely condescends to reason,
scarcely even to state his own belief, but revels in the
more congenial occupation of denouncing the fires of
damnation against the disobedient Emperor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hilary of
Poitiers.</div>

<p>The victory was not to be won by an arm of flesh
like this. Arianism had an enemy more dangerous
than Lucifer. From the sunny land of
Aquitaine, the firmest conquest of Roman
civilization in Atlantic Europe, came Hilary of Poitiers,
the noblest representative of Western literature in the
Nicene age. Hilary was by birth a heathen, and only
turned in ripe manhood from philosophy to Scripture,
coming before us in 355 as an old convert and a
bishop of some standing. He was by far the deepest
thinker of the West, and a match for Athanasius himself
in depth of earnestness and massive strength of
intellect. But Hilary was a student rather than an
orator, a thinker rather than a statesman like Athanasius.
He had not touched the controversy till it was forced
upon him, and would much have preferred to keep out
of it. But when once he had studied the Nicene
doctrine and found its agreement with his own conclusions
from Scripture, a clear sense of duty forbade
him to shrink from manfully defending it. Such was
the man whom the brutal policy of Constantius forced
to take his place at the head of the Nicene opposition.
As he was not present at Milan, the courtiers had to
silence him some other way. In the spring of 356
they exiled him to Asia, on some charge of conduct
'unworthy of a bishop, or even of a layman.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hosius and
Liberius.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Hosius of Cordova was ordered to
Sirmium and there detained. Constantius was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
ashamed to send to the rack the old man who had
been a confessor in his grandfather's days, more than
fifty years before. He was brought at
last to communicate with the Arianizers,
but even in his last illness refused to condemn
Athanasius. After this there was but one power in
the West which could not be summarily dealt with.
The grandeur of Hosius was merely personal, but
Liberius claimed the universal reverence due to the
apostolic and imperial See of Rome. It was a great
and wealthy church, and during the last two hundred
years had won a noble fame for world-wide charity.
Its orthodoxy was without a stain; for whatever
heresies might flow to the great city, no heresy had
ever issued thence. The strangers of every land who
found their way to Rome were welcomed from St.
Peter's throne with the majestic blessing of a universal
father. 'The church of God which sojourneth in
Rome' was the immemorial counsellor of all the
churches; and now that the voice of counsel was
passing into that of command, Bishop Julius had made
a worthy use of his authority as a judge of Christendom.
Such a bishop was a power of the first importance
now that Arianism was dividing the Empire round
the hostile camps of Gaul and Asia. If the Roman
church had partly ceased to be a Greek colony in the
Latin capital, it was still the connecting link of East
and West, the representative of Western Christianity
to the Easterns, and the interpreter of Eastern to the
Latin West. Liberius could therefore treat almost on
the footing of an independent sovereign. He would
not condemn Athanasius unheard, and after so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
acquittals. If Constantius wanted to reopen the case,
he must summon a free council, and begin by expelling
the Arians. To this demand he firmly adhered. The
Emperor's threats he disregarded, the Emperor's gifts
he flung out of the church. It was not long before
Constantius was obliged to risk the scandal of seizing
and carrying off the bishop of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Third exile of
Athanasius
(356).</div>

<p>Athanasius was still at Alexandria. When the
notaries tried to frighten him away, he refused to take
their word against the repeated written
promises of protection he had received from
Constantius himself. Duty as well as
policy forbade him to believe that the most pious
Emperor could be guilty of any such treachery. So
when Syrianus, the general in Egypt, brought up
his troops, it was agreed to refer the whole question to
Constantius. Syrianus broke the agreement. On a
night of vigil (Feb. 8, 356) he surrounded the church
of Theonas with a force of more than five thousand
men. The whole congregation was caught as in a net.
The doors were broken open, and the troops pressed up
the church. Athanasius fainted in the tumult; yet
before they reached the bishop's throne its occupant
had somehow been safely conveyed away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">George of
Cappadocia.</div>

<p>If the soldiers connived at the escape of Athanasius,
they were all the less disposed to spare his flock. The
outrages of Philagrius and Gregory were
repeated by Syrianus and his successor,
Sebastian the Manichee; and the evil work went on
apace after the arrival of the new bishop in Lent 357.
George of Cappadocia is said to have been before this
a pork-contractor for the army, and is certainly no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
credit to Arianism. Though Athanasius does injustice
to his learning, there can be no doubt that he was a
thoroughly bad bishop. Indiscriminate oppression of
Nicenes and heathens provoked resistance from the fierce
populace of Alexandria. George escaped with difficulty
from one riot in August 358, and was fairly driven from
the city by another in October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Athanasius in
exile (356-362).</div>

<p>Meanwhile Athanasius had disappeared from the
eyes of men. A full year after the raid of Syrianus,
he was still unconvinced of the Emperor's
treachery. Outrage after outrage might
turn out to be the work of underlings. Constantine
himself had not despised his cry for justice, and if he
could but stand before the son of Constantine, his
presence might even yet confound the gang of eunuchs.
Even the weakness of Athanasius is full of nobleness.
Not till the work of outrage had gone on for many
months was he convinced. But then he threw off all
restraint. Even George the pork-contractor is not
assailed with such a storm of merciless invective as
his holiness Constantius Augustus. George might sin
'like the beasts who know no better,' but no wickedness
of common mortals could attain to that of the new
Belshazzar, of the Lord's anointed 'self-abandoned to
eternal fire.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political meaning
of his
exile.</div>

<p>The exile governed Egypt from his hiding in the
desert. Alexandria was searched in vain; in vain the
malice of Constantius pursued him to the
court of Ethiopia. Letter after letter issued
from his inaccessible retreat to keep alive
the indignation of the faithful, and invisible hands
conveyed them to the farthest corners of the land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Constantius had his revenge, but it shook the Empire
to its base. It was the first time since the fall of
Israel that a nation had defied the Empire in the
name of God. It was a national rising, none the less
real for not breaking out in formal war. This time
Greeks and Copts were united in defence of the Nicene
faith, so that the contest was at an end when the
Empire gave up Arianism. But the next breach was
never healed. Monophysite Egypt was a dead limb
of the Empire, and the Roman power beyond Mount
Taurus fell before the Saracens because the provincials
would not lift a hand to fight for the heretics of
Chalcedon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sirmian
manifesto (357).</div>

<p>The victory seemed won when the last great enemy
was driven into the desert, and the intriguers hasted
to the spoil. They forgot that the West
was only overawed for the moment, that
Egypt was devoted to its patriarch, that there was a
strong opposition in the East, and that the conservatives,
who had won the battle for them, were not likely
to take up Arianism at the bidding of their unworthy
leaders. Amongst the few prominent Eusebians of
the West were two disciples of Arius who held the
neighbouring bishoprics of Mursa and Singidunum,
the modern Belgrade. Valens and Ursacius were
young men in 335, but old enough to take a part in
the infamous Egyptian commission of the council of
Tyre. Since that time they had been well to the
front in the Eusebian plots. In 347, however, they
had found it prudent to make their peace with Julius of
Rome by confessing the falsehood of their charges
against Athanasius. Of late they had been active on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the winning side, and enjoyed much influence with Constantius.
Thinking it now safe to declare more openly
for Arianism, they called a few bishops to Sirmium in
the summer of 357, and issued a manifesto of their
belief for the time being, to the following general effect.
'We acknowledge one God the Father, also His only
Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. But two Gods must
not be preached. The Father is without beginning,
invisible, and in every respect greater than the Son,
who is subject to Him together with the creatures.
The Son is born of the Father, God of God, by an
inscrutable generation, and took flesh or body, that is,
man, through which he suffered. The words <i>essence</i>, <i>of
the same essence</i>, <i>of like essence</i>, ought not to be used,
because they are not found in Scripture, and because
the divine generation is beyond our understanding.'
Here is something to notice besides the repeated hints
that the Son is no better than a creature. It was a
new policy to make the mystery in the manner of the
divine generation an excuse for ignoring the fact. In
this case the plea of ignorance is simply impertinent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its results in
general.</div>

<p>The Sirmian manifesto is the turning-point of the
whole contest. Arianism had been so utterly crushed
at Nic&aelig;a that it had never again till now
appeared in a public document. Henceforth
the conservatives were obliged in self-defence to
look for a Nicene alliance against the Anom&oelig;ans.
Suspicions and misunderstandings, and at last mere
force, delayed its consolidation till the reign of Theodosius,
but the Eusebian coalition fell to pieces the
moment Arianism ventured to have a policy of its
own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(1.) In the
West.</div>

<p>Ursacius and Valens had blown a trumpet which
was heard from one end of the Empire to the other.
Its avowal of Arianism caused a stir even
in the West. Unlike the creeds of Antioch,
it was a Western document, drawn up in Latin by
Western bishops. The spirit of the West was fairly
roused, now that the battle was clearly for the faith.
The bishops of Rome, Cordova, Trier, Poitiers, Toulouse,
Calaris, Milan, and Vercell&aelig; were in exile, but Gaul
was now partly shielded from persecution by the varying
fortunes of Julian's Alemannic war. Thus everything
increased the ferment. Ph&oelig;badius of Agen
took the lead, and a Gaulish synod at once condemned
the 'blasphemy.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) In the
East.</div>

<p>If the Sirmian manifesto disturbed the West, it
spread dismay through the ranks of the Eastern conservatives.
Plain men were weary of the
strife, and only the fishers in troubled waters
wanted more of it. Now that Marcellus and Photinus
had been expelled, the Easterns looked for rest. But
the Sirmian manifesto opened an abyss at their feet.
The fruits of their hard-won victories over Sabellianism
were falling to the Anom&oelig;ans. They must even defend
themselves, for Ursacius and Valens had the Emperor's
ear. As if to bring the danger nearer home to them,
Eudoxius the new bishop of Antioch, and Acacius of
C&aelig;sarea convened a Syrian synod, and sent a letter of
thanks to the authors of the manifesto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Synod of
Ancyra (Lent,
358).</div>

<p>Next spring came the conservative reply from a knot
of twelve bishops who had met to consecrate a new
church for Basil of Ancyra. But its weight was far beyond
its numbers. Basil's name stood high for learning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and he more than any man could sway the
vacillating Emperor. Eustathius of Sebastia was another
man of mark. His ascetic eccentricities,
long ago condemned by the council of
Gangra, were by this time forgotten or considered
harmless. Above all, the synod represented most
of the Eastern bishops. Pontus indeed was devoted to
conservatism, and the decided Arianizers were hardly
more than a busy clique even in Asia and Syria. Its
decisions show the awkwardness to be expected from
men who have had to make a sudden change of front,
and exhibit well the transition from Eusebian to
Semiarian conservatism. They seem to start from the
declaration of the Lucianic creed, that the Lord's sonship
is not an idle name. Now if we reject materialising
views of the Divine Sonship, its primary meaning
will be found to lie in similarity of essence. On this
ground the Sirmian manifesto is condemned. Then
follow eighteen anathemas, alternately aimed at Aetius
and Marcellus. The last of these condemns the Nicene
<i>of one essence</i>&mdash;clearly as Sabellian, though no reason
is given.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Victory of the
Semiarians.</div>

<p>The synod broke up. Basil and Eustathius went
to lay its decisions before the court at Sirmium. To
conciliate the Nicenes, they left out the last
six anathemas of Ancyra. They were just
in time to prevent Constantius from declaring for
Eudoxius and the Anom&oelig;ans. Peace was made before
long on Semiarian terms. A collection was made of
the decisions against Photinus and Paul of Samosata,
together with the Lucianic creed, and signed by
Liberius of Rome, by Ursacius and Valens, and by all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the Easterns present. Liberius had not borne exile
well. He had already signed some still more compromising
document, and is denounced for it as an
apostate by Hilary and others. However, he was now
allowed to return to his see.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Semiarian
failure.</div>

<p>The Semiarians had won a complete victory. Their
next step was to throw it away. The Anom&oelig;an
leaders were sent into exile. After all,
these Easterns only wanted to replace one
tyranny by another. The exiles were soon recalled,
and the strife began again with more bitterness than
ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of the
Hom&oelig;ans.</div>

<p>Here was an opening for a new party. Semiarians,
Nicenes, and Anom&oelig;ans were equally unable to settle
this interminable controversy. The Anom&oelig;ans
indeed almost deserved success for
their boldness and activity, but pure Arianism was
hopelessly discredited throughout the Empire. The
Nicenes had Egypt and the West, but they could
not at present overcome the court and Asia. The
Semiarians might have mediated, but men who began
with persecutions and wholesale exiles were not likely
to end with peace. In this deadlock better men than
Ursacius and Valens might have been tempted to try
some scheme of compromise. But existing parties
left no room for anything but vague and spacious
charity. If we may say neither <i>of one essence</i> nor <i>of
like essence</i>, nor yet <i>unlike</i>, the only course open is to
say <i>like</i>, and forbid nearer definition. This was the
plan of the new Hom&oelig;an party formed by Acacius in
the East, Ursacius and Valens in the West.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New relations
of parties.</div>

<p>Parties began to group themselves afresh. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Anom&oelig;ans leaned to the side of Acacius. They
had no favour to expect from Nicenes or Semiarians,
but to the Hom&oelig;ans they could look for
connivance at least. The Semiarians were
therefore obliged to draw still closer to the Nicenes.
Here came in Hilary of Poitiers. If he had seen in
exile the worldliness of too many of the Asiatic
bishops, he had also found among them men of a
better sort who were in earnest against Arianism, and
not so far from the Nicene faith as was supposed.
To soften the mutual suspicions of East and West,
he addressed his <i>De Synodis</i> to his Gaulish friends
about the end of 358. In it he reviews the Eusebian
creeds to show that they are not indefensible. He
also compares the rival phrases <i>of one essence</i> and <i>of
like essence</i>, to shew that either of them may be rightly
or wrongly used. The two, however, are properly
identical, for there is no likeness but that of unity,
and no use in the idea of likeness but to exclude
Sabellian confusion. Only the Nicene phrase guards
against evasion, and the other does not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summons for
a council.</div>

<p>Now that the Semiarians were forced to treat with
their late victims on equal terms, they agreed to hold
a general council. Both parties might
hope for success. If the Hom&oelig;an influence
was increasing at court, the Semiarians were strong in
the East, and could count on some help from the
Western Nicenes. But the court was resolved to
secure a decision to its own mind. As a council of
the whole Empire might have been too independent, it
was divided. The Westerns were to meet at Ariminum
in Italy, the Easterns at Seleucia in Isauria; and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
case of disagreement, ten deputies from each side were
to hold a conference before the Emperor. A new
creed was also to be drawn up before their meeting
and laid before them for acceptance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The 'Dated
Creed' (May
22, 359).</div>

<p>The 'Dated Creed' was drawn up at Sirmium on
Pentecost Eve 359, by a small meeting of Hom&oelig;an
and Semiarian leaders. Its prevailing character
is conservative, as we see from its
repeated appeals to Scripture, its solemn
tone of reverence for the person of the Lord, its
rejection of the word <i>essence</i> for the old conservative
reason that it is not found in Scripture, and above
all, from its elaborate statement of the eternity and
mysterious nature of the divine generation. The
chief clause however is, 'But we say that the Son is
<i>like</i> the Father in all things, as the Scriptures say and
teach.' Though the phrase here is Hom&oelig;an, the
doctrine seems at first sight Semiarian, not to say
Nicene. In point of fact, the clause is quite ambiguous.
First, if the comma is put before <i>in all
things</i>, the next words will merely forbid any extension
of the likeness beyond what Scripture allows; and the
Anom&oelig;ans were quite entitled to sign it with the
explanation that for their part they found very little
likeness taught in Scripture. Again, likeness in all
things cannot extend to essence, for all likeness which
is not identity implies difference, if only the comparison
is pushed far enough. So the Anom&oelig;ans
argued, and Athanasius accepts their reasoning. The
Semiarians had ruined their position by attempting to
compromise a fundamental contradiction. The whole
contest was lowered to a court intrigue. There is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
grandeur in the flight of Athanasius, dignity in the
exile of Eunomius; but the conservatives fell ignobly
and unregretted, victims of their own violence and
unprincipled intrigue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Western
Council at
Ariminum.</div>

<p>After signing the creed, Ursacius and Valens went
on to Ariminum, with the Emperor's orders to the
council to take doctrinal questions first, and
not to meddle with Eastern affairs. They
found the Westerns waiting for them, to
the number of more than two hundred. The bishops
were in no courtly temper, and the intimidation was
not likely to be an easy task. They had even refused
the usual imperial help for the expenses of the journey.
Three British bishops only accepted it on the ground
of poverty. The new creed was very ill received; and
when the Hom&oelig;an leaders refused to anathematize
Arianism, they were deposed, 'not only for their
present conspiracy to introduce heresy, but also for
the confusion they had caused in all the churches by
their repeated changes of faith.' The last clause was
meant for Ursacius and Valens. The Nicene creed
was next confirmed, and a statement added in defence
of the word <i>essence</i>. This done, envoys were sent to
report at court and ask the Emperor to dismiss them
to their dioceses, from which they could ill be spared.
Constantius was busy with his preparations for the
Persian war, and refused to see them. They were
sent to wait his leisure, first at Hadrianople, then at
the neighbouring town of Nic&eacute; (chosen to cause confusion
with Nic&aelig;a), where Ursacius and Valens induced
them to sign a revision of the dated creed. The few
changes made in it need not detain us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Eastern
Council at
Seleucia.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Easterns met at Seleucia near the
Cilician coast. It was a fairly central spot, and easy
of access from Egypt and Syria by sea, but
otherwise most unsuitable. It was a mere
fortress, lying in a rugged country, where
the spurs of Mount Taurus reach the sea. Around it
were the ever-restless marauders of Isauria. They had
attacked the place that very spring, and it was still
the headquarters of the army sent against them. The
choice of such a place is as significant as if a Pan-Anglican
synod were called to meet at the central and
convenient port of Souakin. Naturally the council
was a small one. Of the 150 bishops present, about
110 were Semiarians. The Acacians and Anom&oelig;ans
were only forty, but they had a clear plan and the
court in their favour. As the Semiarian leaders had
put themselves in a false position by signing the dated
creed, the conservative defence was taken up by men
of the second rank, like Silvanus of Tarsus and the old
soldier Eleusius of Cyzicus. With them, however,
came Hilary of Poitiers, who, though still an exile,
had been summoned with the rest. The Semiarians
welcomed him, and received him to full communion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its proceedings.</div>

<p>Next morning the first sitting was held. The
Hom&oelig;ans began by proposing to abolish the Nicene creed
in favour of one to be drawn up in scriptural
language. Some of them argued in defiance
of their own Sirmian creed, that 'generation is unworthy
of God. The Lord is creature, not Son, and his generation
is nothing but creation.' The Semiarians, however, had
no objection to the Nicene creed beyond the obscurity
of the word <i>of one essence</i>. The still more important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
<i>of the essence of the Father</i> seems to have passed without
remark. Towards evening Silvanus of Tarsus proposed
to confirm the Lucianic creed, which was done
next morning by the Semiarians only. On the third
day the Count Leonas, who represented the Emperor,
read a document given him by Acacius, which turned
out to be the dated creed revised afresh and with a
new preface. In this the Hom&oelig;ans say that they are
far from despising the Lucianic creed, though it was
composed with reference to other controversies. The
words <i>of one essence</i> and <i>of like essence</i> are next rejected
because they are not found in Scripture, and the new
Anom&oelig;an <i>unlike</i> is anathematized&mdash;'but we clearly
confess the likeness of the Son to the Father, according
to the apostle's words, Who is the image of the invisible
God.' There was a hot dispute on the fourth day,
when Acacius explained the likeness as one of will
only, not extending to essence, and refused to be
bound by his own defence of the Lucianic creed
against Marcellus. Semiarian horror was not diminished
when an extract was read from an obscene
sermon preached by Eudoxius at Antioch. At last
Eleusius broke in upon Acacius&mdash;'Any hole-and-corner
doings of yours at Sirmium are no concern of
ours. Your creed is not the Lucianic, and that is
quite enough to condemn it.' This was decisive.
Next morning the Semiarians had the church to
themselves, for the Hom&oelig;ans, and even Leonas, refused
to come. 'They might go and chatter in the church
if they pleased.' So they deposed Acacius, Eudoxius,
George of Alexandria, and six others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Athanasius <i>de
Synodis</i>.</div>

<p>The exiled patriarch of Alexandria was watching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
from his refuge in the desert, and this was the time
he chose for an overture of friendship to his old conservative
enemies. If he was slow to see his
opportunity, at least he used it nobly. The
Eastern church has no more honoured name than that
of Athanasius, yet even Athanasius rises above himself
in his <i>De Synodis</i>. He had been a champion of
controversy since his youth, and spent his manhood in
the forefront of its hottest battle. The care of many
churches rested on him, the pertinacity of many enemies
wore out his life. Twice he had been driven to the
ends of the earth, and twice come back in triumph;
and now, far on in life, he saw his work again destroyed,
himself once more a fugitive. We do not look for calm
impartiality in a Demosthenes, and cannot wonder if
the bitterness of his long exile grows on even Athanasius.
Yet no sooner is he cheered with the news of
hope, than the jealousies which had grown for forty
years are hushed in a moment, as though the Lord
himself had spoken peace to the tumult of the grey
old exile's troubled soul. To the impenitent Arians
he is as severe as ever, but for old enemies returning
to a better mind he has nothing but brotherly consideration
and respectful sympathy. Men like Basil of
Ancyra, says he, are not to be set down as Arians or
treated as enemies, but to be reasoned with as brethren
who differ from us only about the use of a word which
sums up their own teaching as well as ours. When they
confess that the Lord is a true Son of God and not a
creature, they grant all that we care to contend for.
Their own <i>of like essence</i> without the addition of <i>from
the essence</i> does not exclude the idea of a creature, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the two together are precisely equivalent to <i>of one
essence</i>. Our brethren accept the two separately: we
join them in a single word. Their <i>of like essence</i> is
by itself misleading, for likeness is of properties and
qualities, not of essence, which must be either the
same or different. Thus the word rather suggests
than excludes the limited idea of a sonship which
means no more than a share of grace, whereas our <i>of
one essence</i> quite excludes it. Sooner or later they
will see their way to accept a term which is a necessary
safeguard for the belief they hold in common
with ourselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of the
Council of
Ariminum.</div>

<p>There could be no doubt of the opinion of the churches
when the councils had both so decidedly refused the
dated creed; but the court was not yet at
the end of its resources. The Western
deputies were sent back to Ariminum, and
the bishops, already reduced to great distress by their
long detention, were plied with threats and cajolery
till most of them yielded. When Ph&oelig;badius and a
score of others remained firm, their resistance was
overcome by as shameless a piece of villany as can be
found in history. Valens came forward and declared
that he was not one of the Arians, but heartily detested
their blasphemies. The creed would do very well as it
stood, and the Easterns had accepted it already; but
if Ph&oelig;badius was not satisfied, he was welcome to propose
additions. A stringent series of anathemas was
therefore drawn up against Arius and all his misbelief.
Valens himself contributed one against 'those who say
that the Son of God is a creature like other creatures.'
The court party accepted everything, and the council<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
met for a final reading of the amended creed. Shout
after shout of joy rang through the church when Valens
protested that the heresies were none of his, and with
his own lips pronounced the whole series of anathemas;
and when Claudius of Picenum produced a few more
rumours of heresy, 'which my lord and brother Valens
has forgotten,' they were disavowed with equal readiness.
The hearts of all men melted towards the old
dissembler, and the bishops dispersed from Ariminum
in the full belief that the council would take its place
in history among the bulwarks of the faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conferences at
Constantinople.</div>

<p>The Western council was dissolved in seeming harmony,
but a strong minority disputed the conclusions
of the Easterns at Seleucia. Both parties,
therefore, hurried to Constantinople. But
there Acacius was in his element. He held a splendid
position as the bishop of a venerated church, the disciple
and successor of Eusebius, and himself a patron
of learning and a writer of high repute. His fine gifts
of subtle thought and ready energy, his commanding
influence and skilful policy, marked him out for a
glorious work in history, and nothing but his own
falseness degraded him to be the greatest living
master of backstairs intrigue. If Athanasius is the
Demosthenes of the Nicene age, Acacius will be its
&AElig;schines. He had found his account in abandoning
conservatism for pure Arianism, and was now preparing
to complete his victory by a new treachery to
the Anom&oelig;ans. He had anathematized <i>unlike</i> at
Seleucia, and now sacrificed Aetius to the Emperor's
dislike of him. After this it became possible to enforce
the prohibition of the Nicene <i>of like essence</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Meanwhile the final report arrived from Ariminum.
Valens at once gave an Arian meaning to the anathemas
of Ph&oelig;badius. 'Not a creature like other
creatures.' Then creature he is. 'Not from nothing.'
Quite so: from the will of the Father. 'Eternal.' Of
course, as regards the future. However, the Hom&oelig;ans
repeated the process of swearing that they were not
Arians; the Emperor threatened; and at last the
Seleucian deputies signed the decisions of Ariminum
late on the last night of the year 359.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deposition of
the Semiarians</div>

<p>Acacius had won his victory, and had now to pass
sentence on his rivals. Next month a council was
held at Constantinople. As the Semiarians
of Asia were prudent enough to absent
themselves, the Hom&oelig;ans were dominant. Its first
step was to re-issue the creed of Nic&eacute; with a number
of verbal changes. The anathemas of Ph&oelig;badius having
served their purpose, were of course omitted. Next
Aetius was degraded and anathematized for his impious
and heretical writings, and as 'the author of
all the scandals, troubles, and divisions.' This was
needed to satisfy Constantius; but as many as nine
bishops were found to protest against it. They were
given six months to reconsider the matter, and soon
began to form communities of their own. Having
cleared themselves from the charge of heresy by laying
the foundation of a permanent schism, the Hom&oelig;ans
could proceed to the expulsion of the Semiarian leaders.
As men who had signed the creed of Nic&eacute; could not
well be accused of heresy, they were deposed for various
irregularities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hom&oelig;an
supremacy.</div>

<p>The Hom&oelig;an supremacy established at Constantinople<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
was limited to the East. Violence was its only
resource beyond the Alps; and violence was out of the
question after the mutiny at Paris (Jan.
360) had made Julian master of Gaul. Now
that he could act for himself, common sense as well as
inclination forbade him to go on with the mischievous
policy of Constantius. So there was no further question
of Arian domination. Few bishops were committed to
the losing side, and those few soon disappeared in the
course of nature. Auxentius the Cappadocian, who
held the see of Milan till 374, must have been one
of the last survivors of the victors of Ariminum. In
the East, however, the Hom&oelig;an supremacy lasted
nearly twenty years. No doubt it was an artificial
power, resting partly on court intrigue, partly on the
divisions of its enemies; yet there was a reason for
its long duration. Eusebian conservatism was fairly
worn out, but the Nicene doctrine had not yet replaced
it. Men were tired of these philosophical
word-battles, and ready to ask whether the difference
between Nic&eacute; and Nic&aelig;a was worth fighting about.
The Hom&oelig;an formula seemed reverent and safe, and
its bitterest enemies could hardly call it false. When
even the court preached peace and charity, the sermon
was not likely to want an audience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hom&oelig;an
policy.</div>

<p>The Hom&oelig;ans were at first less hostile to the
Nicene faith than the Eusebians had been. After
sacrificing Aetius and exiling the Semiarians,
they could hardly do without Nicene
support. Thus their appointments were often made
from the quieter men of Nicene leanings. If we have
to set on the other side the enthronement of Eudoxius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
at Constantinople and the choice of Eunomius the
Anom&oelig;an for the see of Cyzicus, we can only say that
the Hom&oelig;an party was composed of very discordant
elements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appointment
of Meletius.</div>

<p>The most important nomination ascribed to Acacius
is that of Meletius at Antioch to replace Eudoxius.
The new bishop was a man of distinguished
eloquence and undoubted piety, and further
suited for a dangerous elevation by his peaceful temper
and winning manners. He was counted among the
Hom&oelig;ans, and they had placed him a year before in
the room of Eustathius at Sebastia, so that his uncanonical
translation to Antioch engaged him all the
more to remain on friendly terms with them. Such
a man&mdash;and of course Acacius was shrewd enough to
see it&mdash;would have been a tower of strength to them.
Unfortunately, for once Acacius was not all-powerful.
Some evil-disposed person put Constantius on demanding
from the new bishop a sermon on the crucial text
'The Lord created me.'<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Acacius, who preached first,
evaded the test, but Meletius, as a man of honour, could
not refuse to declare himself. To the delight of the congregation,
his doctrine proved decidedly Nicene. It was
a test for his hearers as well as for himself. He carefully
avoided technical terms, repudiated Marcellus, and
repeatedly deprecated controversy on the ineffable mystery
of the divine generation. In a word, he followed
closely the lines of the Sirmian creed; and his treatment
by the Hom&oelig;ans is a decisive proof of their
insincerity. The people applauded, but the courtiers
were covered with shame. There was nothing for it
but to exile Meletius at once and appoint a new
bishop. This time they made sure of their man b<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>y
choosing Euzoius, the old friend of Arius. But the
mischief was already done. The old congregation of
Leontius was broken up, and a new schism, more dangerous
than the Eustathian, formed round Meletius.
Many jealousies still divided him from the Nicenes, but
his bold confession was the first effective blow at the
Hom&oelig;an supremacy.</p>

<p>The idea of conciliating Nicene support was not
entirely given up. Acacius remained on friendly
terms with Meletius, and was still able to
name Pelagius for the see of Laodicea.
But Euzoius was an avowed Arian; Eudoxius differed
little from him, and only the remaining scruples of
Constantius delayed the victory of the Anom&oelig;ans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>THE REIGN OF JULIAN.</i></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Earlier life
of Julian.</div>

<p>Flavius Claudius Julianus was the son of Constantine's
half-brother, Julius Constantius, by his second
wife, Basilina, a lady of the great Anician
family. He was born in 331, and lost his
mother a few months later, while his father and other
relations perished in the massacre which followed
Constantine's death. Julian and his half-brother
Gallus escaped the slaughter to be kept almost as
prisoners of state, surrounded through their youth with
spies and taught by hypocrites a repulsive Christianity.
Julian, however, had a literary education from his
mother's old teacher, the eunuch Mardonius; and this
was his happiness till he was old enough to attend the
rhetoricians at Nicomedia and elsewhere. Gallus was
for a while C&aelig;sar in Syria (351-354), and after his
execution, Julian's own life was only saved by the
Empress Eusebia, who got permission for him to retire
to the schools of Athens. In 355 he was made C&aelig;sar
in Gaul, and with much labour freed the province
from the Germans. Early in 360 the soldiers mutinied
at Paris and proclaimed Julian Augustus. Negotiations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
followed, and it was not till the summer of 361
that Julian pushed down the Danube. By the time
he halted at Naissus, he was master of three-quarters
of the Empire. There seemed no escape from civil
war now that the main army of Constantius was
coming up from Syria. But one day two barbarian
counts rode into Julian's camp with the news that
Constantius was dead. A sudden fever had carried
him off in Cilicia (Nov. 3, 361), and the Eastern army
presented its allegiance to Julian Augustus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Julian's
heathenism.</div>

<p>Before we can understand Julian's influence on the
Arian controversy, we shall have to take a wider view
of the Emperor himself and of his policy
towards the Christians generally. The life
of Julian is one of the noblest wrecks in history. The
years of painful self-repression and forced dissimulation
which turned his bright youth to bitterness and filled
his mind with angry prejudice, had only consolidated
his self-reliant pride and firm determination to walk
worthily before the gods. In four years his splendid
energy and unaffected kindliness had won all hearts
in Gaul; and Julian related nothing of his sense of
duty to the Empire when he found himself master of
the world at the age of thirty.</p>

<p>But here came in that fatal heathen prejudice, which
put him in a false relation to all the living powers of
his time, and led directly even to his military disaster
in Assyria. Heathen pride came to him with Basilina's
Roman blood, and the dream-world of his lonely youth
was a world of heathen literature. Christianity was
nothing to him but 'the slavery of a Persian prison.'
Fine preachers of the kingdom of heaven were those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
fawning eunuchs and episcopal sycophants, with Constantius
behind them, the murderer of all his family!
Every force about him worked for heathenism. The
teaching of Mardonius was practically heathen, and
the rest were as heathen as utter worldliness could
make them. He could see through men like George
the pork-contractor or the shameless renegade Hecebolius.
Full of thoughts like these, which corroded
his mind the more for the danger of expressing them,
Julian was easily won to heathenism by the fatherly
welcome of the philosophers at Nicomedia (351).
Like a voice of love from heaven came their teaching,
and Julian gave himself heart and soul to the mysterious
fascination of their lying theurgy. Henceforth King
Sun was his guardian deity, and Greece his Holy Land,
and the philosopher's mantle dearer to him than the
diadem of empire. For ten more years of painful
dissimulation Julian 'walked with the gods' in secret,
before the young lion of heathenism could openly throw
off the 'donkey's skin' of Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Julian's reorganisation
of
heathenism.</div>

<p>Once master of the world, Julian could see its needs
without using the eyes of the Asiatic camarilla. First
of all, Christian domination must be put
down. Not that he wanted to raise a
savage persecution. Cruelty had been well
tried before, and it would be a poor success to stamp
out the 'Galilean' imposture without putting something
better in its place. As the Christians 'had filled
the world with their tombs' (Julian's word for churches),
so must it be filled with the knowledge of the living
gods. Sacrifices were encouraged and a pagan hierarchy
set up to oppose the Christian. Heathen schools<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
were to confront the Christian, and heathen almshouses
were to grow up round them. Above all, the priests
were to cultivate temperance and hospitality, and to
devote themselves to grave and pious studies. Julian
himself was a model of heathen purity, and spared no
pains to infect his wondering subjects with his own
enthusiasm for the cause of the immortal gods. Not
a temple missed its visit, not a high place near his
line of march was left unclimbed. As for his sacrifices,
they were by the hecatomb. The very abjects called
him Slaughterer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His failure.</div>

<p>Never was a completer failure. Crowds of course
applauded C&aelig;sar, but only with the empty cheers they
gave the jockeys or the preachers. Multitudes
came to see an Emperors devotions,
but they only quizzed his shaggy beard or tittered at
the antiquated ceremonies. Sacrificial dinners kept
the soldiers devout, and lavish bribery secured a good
number of renegades&mdash;mostly waverers, who really had
not much to change. Of the bishops, Pegasius of
Ilium alone laid down his office for a priesthood; but
he had always been a heathen at heart, and worshipped
the gods even while he held his bishopric. The
Christians upon the whole stood firm. Even the
heathens were little moved. Julian's own teachers
held cautiously aloof from his reforms; and if meaner
men paused in their giddy round of pleasure, it was
only to amuse themselves with the strange spectacle
of imperial earnestness. Neither friends nor enemies
seemed able to take him quite seriously.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Julian's policy
against Christianity.</div>

<p>Passing over scattered cases of persecution encouraged
or allowed by Julian, we may state generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that he aimed at degrading Christianity into a
vulgar superstition, by breaking its connections with
civilized government on one side, with
liberal education on the other. One part
of it was to deprive the 'Galileans' of state
support and weed them out as far as might be from
the public service, while still leaving them full freedom
to quarrel amongst themselves; the other was to cut
them off from literature by forbidding them to teach
the classics. Homer and Hesiod were prophets of the
gods, and must not be expounded by unbelievers.
Matthew and Luke were good enough for barbarian
ears like theirs. We need not pause to note the
impolicy of an edict which Julian's own admirer
Ammianus wishes 'buried in eternal silence.' Its
effect on the Christians was very marked. Marius
Victorinus, the favoured teacher of the Roman nobles,
at once resigned his chair of rhetoric. The studies of
his old age had brought him to confess his faith in
Christ, and he would not now deny his Lord. Julian's
own teacher Pro&aelig;resius gave up his chair at Athens,
refusing the special exemption which was offered him.
It was not all loss for the Christians to be reminded
that the gospel is revelation, not philosophy&mdash;life and
not discussion. But Greek literature was far too
weak to bear the burden of a sinking world, and its
guardians could not have devised a more fatal plan
than this of setting it in direct antagonism to the
living power of Christianity. In our regret for the
feud between Hellenic culture and the medi&aelig;val
churches, we must not forget that it was Julian who
drove in the wedge of separation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Julian's toleration.</div>

<p>We can now sum up in a sentence. Every blow
struck at Christianity by Julian fell first on the
Arianizers whom Constantius had left in
power, and the reaction he provoked against
heathen learning directly threatened the philosophical
postulates of Arianism within the church. In both
ways he powerfully helped the Nicene cause. The
Hom&oelig;ans could not stand without court support, and
the Anom&oelig;ans threw away their rhetoric on men who
were beginning to see how little ground is really common
to the gospel and philosophy. Yet he cared little
for the party quarrels of the Christians. Instead of
condescending to take a side, he told them contemptuously
to keep the peace. His first step was to
proclaim full toleration for all sorts and sects of men.
It was only too easy to strike at the church by doing
common justice to the sects. A few days later came
an edict recalling the exiled bishops. Their property
was restored, but they were not replaced in their
churches. Others were commonly in possession, and
it was no business of Julian's to turn them out. The
Galileans might look after their own squabbles. This
sounds fairly well, and suits his professions of toleration;
but Julian had a malicious hope of still further
embroiling the ecclesiastical confusion. If the Christians
were only left to themselves, they might be trusted
'to quarrel like beasts.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its results.</div>

<p>Julian was gratified with a few unseemly wrangles,
but the general result of his policy was unexpected.
It took the Christians by surprise, and fairly
shamed them into a sort of truce. The
very divisions of churches are in some sense a sign of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
life, for men who do not care about religion will
usually find something else to quarrel over. If nations
redeem each other, so do parties; and the dignified
slumber of a catholic uniformity may be more fatal to
spiritual life than the vulgar wranglings of a thousand
sects. The Christians closed their ranks before the
common enemy. Nicenes and Arians forgot their
enmity in the pleasant task of reviling the gods and
cursing Julian. A yell of execration ran all along the
Christian line, from the extreme Apollinarian right
to the furthest Anom&oelig;an left. Basil of C&aelig;sarea renounced
the apostate's friendship; the rabble of Antioch
assailed him with scurrilous lampoons and anti-pagan
riots. Nor were the Arians behind in hate. Blind
old Maris of Chalcedon came and cursed him to his
face. The heathens laughed, the Christians cursed, and
Israel alone remembered Julian for good. 'Treasured
in the house of Julianus C&aelig;sar,' the vessels of the temple
still await the day when Messiah-ben-Ephraim shall
take them thence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return of
Athanasius,
Feb. 362.</div>

<p>Back to their dioceses came the survivors of the
exiled bishops, no longer travelling in pomp and
circumstance to their noisy councils, but
bound on the nobler errand of seeking out
their lost or scattered flocks. Eusebius of
Vercell&aelig; and Lucifer left Upper Egypt, Marcellus and
Basil returned to Ancyra, while Athanasius reappeared
at Alexandria. The unfortunate George had led a
wandering life since his expulsion in 358, and did not
venture to leave the shelter of the court till late in 361.
It was a rash move, for his flock had not forgotten him.
Three days he spent in safety, but on the fourth came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
news that Constantius was dead and Julian master of
the Empire. The heathen populace was wild with
delight, and threw George straight into prison. Three
weeks later they dragged him out and lynched him.
Thus when Julian's edict came for the return of the
exiles, Athanasius was doubly prepared to take advantage
of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Council of
Alexandria
discusses:</div>

<p>It was time to resume the interrupted work of the
council of Seleucia. Semiarian violence frustrated
Hilary's efforts, but Athanasius had things
more in his favour, now that Julian had
sobered Christian partizanship. If he
wished the Galileans to quarrel, he also left them free to
combine. So twenty-one bishops, mostly exiles, met at
Alexandria in the summer of 362. Eusebius of Vercell&aelig;
was with Athanasius, but Lucifer had gone to Antioch,
and only sent a couple of deacons to the meeting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(1.) Returning
Arians.</div>

<p>Four subjects claimed the council's attention. The
first was the reception of Arians who came over to
the Nicene side. The stricter party was for
treating all opponents without distinction
as apostates. Athanasius, however, urged a milder
course. It was agreed that all comers were to be
gladly received on the single condition of accepting
the Nicene faith. None but the chiefs and active defenders
of Arianism were even to be deprived of any ecclesiastical
rank which they might be holding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) The Lord's
human nature.</div>

<p>A second subject of debate was the Arian doctrine
of the Lord's humanity, which limited it to a human
body. In opposition to this, the council
declared that the Lord assumed also a
human soul. In this they may have had in view,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
besides Arianism, the new theory of Apollinarius of
Laodicea, which we shall have to explain presently.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3.) The words
<i>person</i> and
<i>essence</i>.</div>

<p>The third subject before the council was an old
misunderstanding about the term <i>hypostasis</i>. It had
been used in the Nicene anathemas as equivalent
to <i>ousia</i> or <i>essence</i>; and so Athanasius
used it still, to denote the common
deity of all the persons of the Trinity. So also the
Latins understood it, as the etymological representative
of <i>substantia</i>, which was their translation (a very bad one
by the way) of <i>ousia</i> (<i>essence</i>). Thus Athanasius and the
Latins spoke of one <i>hypostasis</i> (<i>essence</i>) only. Meantime
the Easterns in general had adopted Origen's limitation
of it to the deity of the several <i>persons</i> of the Trinity
in contrast with each other. Thus they meant by it
what the Latins called <i>persona</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and rightly spoke of
three <i>hypostases</i> (<i>persons</i>). In this way East and West
were at cross-purposes. The Latins, who spoke of one
<i>hypostasis</i> (<i>essence</i>), regarded the Eastern three <i>hypostases</i>
as tritheist; while the Greeks, who confessed three
<i>hypostases</i> (<i>persons</i>), looked on the Western one <i>hypostasis</i>
as Sabellian. As Athanasius had connections
with both parties, he was a natural mediator. As soon
as both views were stated before the council, both were
seen to be orthodox. 'One <i>hypostasis</i>' (<i>essence</i>) was
not Sabellian, neither was 'three <i>hypostases</i>' (<i>persons</i>)
Arian. The decision was that each party might keep
its own usage.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_14" id="Footnote_1_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_14"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>Persona</i>, again, was a legal term, not exactly corresponding to its
Greek representative.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">(4.) The schism
at Antioch.</div>

<p>Affairs at Antioch remained for discussion. Now
that Meletius was free to return, some decision had to
be made. The Eustathians had been faithful through
thirty years of trouble, and Athanasius was specially
bound to his old frien<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>ds; yet, on the other
hand, some recognition was due to the honourable
confession of Meletius. As the Eustathians
had no bishop, the simplest course was for them to
accept Meletius. This was the desire of the council,
and it might have been carried out if Lucifer had not
taken advantage of his stay at Antioch to denounce
Meletius as an associate of Arians. By way of making
the division permanent, he consecrated the presbyter
Paulinus as bishop for the Eustathians. When the
mischief was done it could not be undone. Paulinus
added his signature to the decisions of Alexandria,
but Meletius was thrown back on his old connection
with Acacius. Henceforth the rising Nicene party
of Pontus and Asia was divided from the older Nicenes
of Egypt and Rome by this unfortunate personal question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fourth exile
of Athanasius.</div>

<p>Julian could not but see that Athanasius was master
in Egypt. He may not have cared about the council,
but the baptism of some heathen ladies at
Alexandria roused his fiercest anger. He
broke his rule of contemptuous toleration, and 'the
detestable Athanasius' was an exile again before the
summer was over. But his work remained. The
leniency of the council was a great success, notwithstanding
the calamity at Antioch. It gave offence,
indeed, to zealots like Lucifer, and may have admitted
more than one unworthy Arianizer. Yet its wisdom
is evident. First one bishop, then another accepted
the Nicene faith. Friendly Semiarians came in like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Cyril of Jerusalem, old conservatives followed like
Dianius of the Cappadocian C&aelig;sarea, and at last the
arch-heretic Acacius himself gave in his signature.
Even the creeds of the churches were remodelled in a
Nicene interest, as at Jerusalem and Antioch, in Cappadocia
and Mesopotamia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arians
under Julian.</div>

<p>Nor were the other parties idle. The Hom&oelig;an
coalition was even more unstable than the Eusebian.
Already before the death of Constantius
there had been quarrels over the appointment
of Meletius by one section of the party, of
Eunomius by another. The deposition of Aetius was
another bone of contention. Hence the coalition broke
up of itself as soon as men were free to act. Acacius
and his friends drew nearer to Meletius, while Eudoxius
and Euzoius talked of annulling the condemnation
of the Anom&oelig;an bishops at Constantinople. The Semiarians
were busy too. Guided by Macedonius and
Eleusius, the ejected bishops of Constantinople and
Cyzicus, they gradually took up a middle position between
Nicenes and Anom&oelig;ans, confessing the Lord's
deity with the one, and denying that of the Holy
Spirit with the other. Like true Legitimists, who had
learned nothing and forgotten nothing, they were
satisfied to confirm the Seleucian decisions and re-issue
their old Lucianic creed. Had they ceased to care
for the Nicene alliance, or did they fancy the world
had stood still since the Council of the Dedication?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Julian's campaign
in Persia
(Mar. 5 to June
26, 363).</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Persian war demanded Julian's attention.
An emperor so full of heathen enthusiasm was
not likely to forego the dreams of conquest which
had brought so many of his predecessors on the path<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of glory in the East. His own part of the campaign
was a splendid success. But when he had fought
his way through the desert to the Tigris,
he looked in vain for succours from the
north. The Christians of Armenia would not
fight for the apostate Emperor. Julian was obliged
to retreat on Nisibis through a wasted country, and
with the Persian cavalry hovering round. The campaign
would have been at best a brilliant failure, but
it was only converted into absolute disaster by the
chance arrow (June 26, 363) which cut short his
busy life. After all, he was only in his thirty-second
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Julian's
character.</div>

<p>Christian charity will not delight in counting up
the outbreaks of petty spite and childish vanity which
disfigure a noble character of purity and
self-devotion. Still less need we presume
to speculate what Julian would have done if he had
returned in triumph from the Persian war. His
bitterness might have hardened into a renegade's
malice, or it might have melted at our Master's touch.
But apart from what he might have done, there is
matter for the gravest blame in what he did. The
scorner must not pass unchallenged to the banquet of
the just. Yet when all is said against him, the clear
fact remains that Julian lived a hero's life. Often as
he was blinded by his impatience or hurried into injustice
by his heathen prejudice, we cannot mistake a
spirit of self-sacrifice and earnest piety as strange to
worldling bishops as to the pleasure-loving heathen
populace. Mysterious and full of tragic pathos is the
irony of God in history, which allowed one of the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
noblest of the emperors to act the part of Jeroboam,
and brought the old intriguer Maris of Chalcedon to
cry against the altar like the man of God from Judah.
But Maris was right, for Julian was the blinder of
the two.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>THE RESTORED HOM&OElig;AN SUPREMACY.</i></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Effects of
Julian's reign.</div>

<p>Julian's reign seems at first sight no more than a
sudden storm which clears up and leaves everything
much as it was before. Far from restoring
heathenism, he could not even seriously
shake the power of Christianity. No sooner was he
dead than the philosophers disappeared, the renegades
did penance, and even the reptiles of the palace came
back to their accustomed haunts. Yet Julian's work
was not in vain, for it tested both heathenism and
Christianity. All that Constantine had given to the
churches Julian could take away, but the living power
of faith was not at C&aelig;sar's beck and call. Heathenism
was strong in its associations with Greek philosophy
and culture, with Roman law and social life, but as
a moral force among the common people, its weakness
was contemptible. It could sway the wavering multitude
with superstitious fancies, and cast a subtler spell
upon the noblest Christian teachers, but its own
adherents it could hardly lift above their petty quest
of pleasure. Julian called aloud, and called in vain.
A mocking echo was the only answer from that valley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of dry bones. Christianity, on the other side, had won
the victory almost without a blow. Instead of ever
coming to grapple with its mighty rival, the great
catholic church of heathenism hardly reached the stage
of apish mimicry. When its great army turned out
to be a crowd of camp-followers, the alarm of battle
died away in peals of defiant laughter. Yet the
alarm was real, and its teachings were not forgotten.
It broke up the revels of party strife, and partly roused
the churches to the dangers of a purely heathen education.
Above all, the approach of danger was a sharp
reminder that our life is not of this world. They stood
the test fairly well. Renegades or fanatics were old
scandals, and signs were not wanting that the touch of
persecution would wake the old heroic spirit which had
fought the Empire from the catacombs and overcome it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jovian Emperor
(June
27, 363).</div>

<p>As Julian was the last survivor of the house of
Constantine, his lieutenants were free to choose the
worthiest of their comrades. But while his
four barbarian generals were debating, one
or two voices suddenly hailed Jovian as Emperor.
The cry was taken up, and in a few moments the
young officer found himself the successor of Augustus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jovian's
toleration.</div>

<p>Jovian was a brilliant colonel of the guards. In
all the army there was not a goodlier person than
he. Julian's purple was too small for his
gigantic limbs. But that stately form was
animated by a spirit of cowardly selfishness. Instead
of pushing on with Julian's brave retreat, he saved the
relics of his army by a disgraceful peace. Jovian was
also a decided Christian, though his morals suited
neither the purity of the gospel nor the dignity of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
imperial position. Even the heathen soldiers condemned
his low amours and vulgar tippling. The
faith he professed was the Nicene, but Constantine
himself was less tolerant than Jovian. In this respect
he is blameless. If Athanasius was graciously received
at Antioch, even the Arians were told with scant ceremony
that they might hold their assemblies as they
pleased at Alexandria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Anom&oelig;ans
form a sect.</div>

<p>About this time the Anom&oelig;ans organised their
schism. Nearly four years had been spent in uncertain
negotiations for the restoration of Aetius.
The Anom&oelig;ans counted on Eudoxius, but
did not find him very zealous in the matter. At last,
in Jovian's time, they made up their minds to set him
at defiance by consecrating P&oelig;menius to the see of
Constantinople. Other appointments were made at
the same time, and Theophilus the Indian, who had
a name for missionary work in the far East, was sent
to Antioch to win over Euzoius. From this time the
Anom&oelig;ans were an organized sect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nicene successes.</div>

<p>But the most important document of Jovian's reign
is the acceptance of the Nicene creed by Acacius of
C&aelig;sarea, with Meletius of Antioch and more
than twenty others of his friends. Acacius
was only returning to his master's steps when he explained
<i>one in essence</i> by <i>like in essence</i>, and laid stress
on the care with which 'the Fathers' had guarded its
meaning. We may hope that Acacius had found out
his belief at last. Still the connexion helped to widen
the breach between Meletius and the older Nicenes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Valentinian
Emperor.</div>

<p>All these movements came to an end at the sudden
death of Jovian (Feb. 16, 364.) The Pannonian Valentinian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
was chosen to succeed him, and a month later
assigned the East to his brother Valens, reserving to
himself the more important Western provinces.
This was a lasting division of the
Empire, for East and West were never again united for
any length of time. Valentinian belongs to the better
class of emperors. He was a soldier like Jovian, and
held much the same rank at his election. He was a
decided Christian like Jovian, and, like him, free from
the stain of persecution. Jovian's rough good-humour
was replaced in Valentinian by a violent and sometimes
cruel temper, but he had a sense of duty and was free
from Jovian's vices. His reign was a laborious and
honourable struggle with the enemies of the republic
on the Rhine and the Danube. An uncultivated man
himself, he still could honour learning, and in religion
his policy was one of comprehensive toleration. If he
refused to displace the few Arians whom he found in
possession of Western sees like Auxentius at Milan,
he left the churches free to choose Nicene successors.
Under his wise rule the West soon recovered from the
strife Constantius had introduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character of
Valens.</div>

<p>Valens was a weaker character, timid, suspicious,
and slow, yet not ungentle in private life. He was as
uncultivated as his brother, but not inferior
to him in scrupulous care for his subjects.
Only as Valens was no soldier, he preferred remitting
taxation to fighting at the head of the legions. In
both ways he is entitled to head the series of financial
rather than unwarlike sovereigns whose cautious policy
brought the Eastern Empire safely through the great
barbarian invasions of the fifth century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Breach between
church
and state.</div>

<p>The contest entered on a new stage in the reign of
Valens. The friendly league of church and state at
Nic&aelig;a had become a struggle for supremacy.
Constantius endeavoured to dictate the faith
of Christendom according to the pleasure
of his eunuchs, while Athanasius reigned in Egypt
almost like a rival for the Empire. And if Julian's
reign had sobered party spirit, it had also shown that
an emperor could sit again in Satan's seat. Valens
had an obedient Hom&oelig;an clergy, but no trappings
of official splendour could enable Eudoxius or Demophilus
to rival the imposing personality of Athanasius
or Basil. Thus the Empire lost the moral support it
looked for, and the church became embittered with its
wrongs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise of monasticism.</div>

<p>The breach involved a deeper evil. The ancient
world of heathenism was near its dissolution. Vice
and war, and latterly taxation, had dried
up the springs of prosperity, and even of
population, till Rome was perishing for lack of men.
Cities had dwindled into villages, and of villages the
very names had often disappeared. The stout Italian
yeomen had been replaced by gangs of slaves, and these
again by thinly scattered barbarian serfs. And if
Rome grew weaker every day, her power for oppression
seemed only to increase. Her fiscal system filled the
provinces with ruined men. The Alps, the Taurus,
and the Balkan swarmed with outlaws. But in the
East men looked for refuge to the desert, where many
a legend told of a people of brethren dwelling together
in unity and serving God in peace beyond the reach
of the officials. This was the time when the ascetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
spirit, which had long been hovering round the outskirts
of Christianity, began to assume the form of
monasticism. There were monks in Egypt&mdash;monks of
Serapis&mdash;before Christianity existed, and there may
have been Christian monks by the end of the third
century. In any case, they make little show in history
before the reign of Valens. Paul of Thebes, Hilarion
of Gaza, and even the great Antony are only characters
in the novels of the day. Now, however, there was
in the East a real movement towards monasticism.
All parties favoured it. The Semiarians were busy
inside Mount Taurus; and though Acacians and
Anom&oelig;ans held more aloof, they could not escape an
influence which even Julian felt. But the Nicene
party was the home of the ascetics. In an age of
indecision and frivolity like the Nicene, the most
earnest striving after Christian purity will often degenerate
into its ascetic caricature. Through the
selfish cowardice of the monastic life we often see the
loving sympathy of Christian self-denial. Thus there
was an element of true Christian zeal in the enthusiasm
of the Eastern Churches; and thus it was that the
rising spirit of asceticism naturally attached itself to
the Nicene faith as the strongest moral power in
Christendom. It was a protest against the whole
framework of society in that age, and therefore the
alliance was cemented by a common enmity to the
Arian Empire. It helped much to conquer Arianism,
but it left a lasting evil in the lowering of the Christian
standard. Henceforth the victory of faith was not to
overcome the world, but to flee from it. Even heathen
immorality was hardly more ruinous than the unclean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
ascetic spirit which defames God's holy ordinance as a
form of sin which a too indulgent Lord will overlook.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New questions
in controversy.</div>

<p>Valens was only a catechumen, and had no policy
to declare for the present. Events therefore continued
to develop naturally. The Hom&oelig;an bishops
retained their sees, but their influence was
fast declining. The Anom&oelig;ans were forming a schism
on one side, the Nicenes recovering power on the
other. Unwilling signatures to the Hom&oelig;an creed
were revoked in all directions. Some even of its
authors declared for Arianism with Euzoius, while
others drew nearer to the Nicene faith like Acacius.
On all sides the simpler doctrines were driving out
the compromises. It was time for the Semiarians to
bestir themselves if they meant to remain a majority
in the East. The Nicenes seemed daily to gain
ground. Lucifer had compromised them in one
direction, Apollinarius in another, and even Marcellus
had never been frankly disavowed; yet the Nicene
cause advanced. A new question, however, was beginning
to come forward. Hitherto the dispute had
been on the person of the Lord, while that of the
Holy Spirit was quite in the background. Significant
as is the tone of Scripture, the proof is not on the
surface. The divinity of the Holy Spirit is shown
by many convergent lines of evidence, but it was still
an open question whether that divinity amounts to
co-essential and co-equal deity. Thus Origen leans
to some theory of subordination, while Hilary limits
himself with the utmost caution to the words of
Scripture. If neither of them lays down in so many
words that the Holy Spirit is God, much less does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
either of them class him with the creatures, like
Eunomius. The difficulty was the same as with the
person of the Lord, that while the Scriptural data
clearly pointed to his deity, its admission involved the
dilemma of either Sabellian confusion or polytheistic
separation. Now, however, it was beginning to be
seen that the theory of hypostatic distinctions must
either be extended to the Holy Spirit or entirely
abandoned. Athanasius took one course, the Anom&oelig;ans
the other, but the Semiarians endeavoured
to draw a distinction between the Lord's deity and
that of the Holy Spirit. In truth, the two are
logically connected. Athanasius pointed this out in
the letters of his exile to Serapion, and the council of
Alexandria condemned 'those who say that the Holy
Spirit is a creature and distinct from the essence of
the Son.' But logical connection is one thing, formal
enforcement another. Athanasius and Basil to the
last refused to make it a condition of communion.
If any one saw the error of his Arian ways, it was
enough for him to confess the Nicene creed. Thus
the question remained open for the present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Council of
Lampsacus
(364).</div>

<p>Thus the Semiarians were free to do what they
could against the Hom&oelig;ans. Under the guidance of
Eleusius of Cyzicus, they held a council
at Lampsacus in the summer of 364. It
sat two months, and reversed the acts of
the Hom&oelig;ans at Constantinople four years before.
Eudoxius was deposed (in name) and the Semiarian
exiles restored to their sees. With regard to doctrine,
they adopted the formula <i>like according to essence</i>, on
the ground that while likeness was needed to exclude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
a Sabellian (they mean Nicene) confusion, its express
extension to essence was needed against the Arians.
Nor did they forget to re-issue the Lucianic creed for
the acceptance of the churches. They also discussed
without result the deity of the Holy Spirit. Eustathius
of Sebastia for one was not prepared to commit himself
either way. The decisions were then laid before
Valens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hom&oelig;an
policy of
Valens.</div>

<p>But Valens was already falling into bad hands.
Now that Julian was dead, the courtiers were fast
recovering their influence, and Eudoxius
had already secured the Emperor's support.
The deputies of Lampsacus were ordered to
hold communion with the bishop of Constantinople,
and exiled on their refusal.</p>

<p>Looking back from our own time, we should say
that it was not a promising course for Valens to
support the Hom&oelig;ans. They had been in power
before, and if they had not then been able to establish
peace in the churches, they were not likely to succeed
any better after their heavy losses in Julian's time.
It is therefore the more important to see the Emperor's
motives. No doubt personal influences must count
for a good deal with a man like Valens, whose private
attachments were so steady. Eudoxius was, after all,
a man of experience and learning, whose mild prudence
was the very help which Valens needed. The Empress
Dominica was also a zealous Arian, so that the courtiers
were Arians too. No wonder if their master was
sincerely attached to the doctrines of his friends. But
Valens was not strong enough to impose his own
likings on the Empire. No merit raised him to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
throne; no education or experience prepared him for
the august dignity he reached so suddenly in middle
life. Conscientious and irresolute, he could not even
firmly control the officials. He had not the magic of
Constantine's name behind him, and was prevented by
Valentinian's toleration from buying support with the
spoils of the temples.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, he could hardly do
otherwise than support the Hom&oelig;ans. Heathenism
had failed in Julian's hands, and an Anom&oelig;an course
was out of the question. A Nicene policy might
answer in the West, but it was not likely to find much
support in the East outside Egypt. The only alternative
was to favour the Semiarians; and even that was
full of difficulties. After all, the Hom&oelig;ans were still
the strongest party in 365. They were in possession
of the churches and commanded much of the Asiatic
influence, and had no enmity to contend with which
was not quite as bitter against the other parties.
They also had astute leaders, and a doctrine which
still presented attractions to the quiet men who were
tired of controversy. Upon the whole, the Hom&oelig;an
policy was the easiest for the moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The exiles
exiled again.</div>

<p>In the spring of 365 an imperial rescript commanded
the municipalities, under a heavy penalty, to drive out
the bishops who had been exiled by Constantius
and restored by Julian. Thereupon
the populace of Alexandria declared that the law
did not apply to Athanasius, because he had not been
restored by Julian. A series of dangerous riots
followed, which obliged the prefect Flavianus to refer
the question back to Valens. Other bishops were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
less fortunate. Meletius had to retire from Antioch,
Eustathius from Sebastia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Semiarian
embassy to
Liberius.</div>

<p>The Semiarians looked to Valentinian for help. He
had received them favourably the year before, and his
intercession was not likely to be disregarded
now. Eustathius of Sebastia was therefore
sent to lay their case before the court of
Milan. As, however, Valentinian had already started
for Gaul, the deputation turned aside to Rome and
offered to Liberius an acceptance of the Nicene creed
signed by fifty-nine Semiarians, and purporting to
come from the council of Lampsacus and other Asiatic
synods. The message was well received at Rome, and
in due time the envoys returned to Asia to report their
doings before a council at Tyana.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revolt of
Procopius,
Sept. 365.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the plans of Valens were interrupted by
the news that Constantinople had been seized by a
pretender. Procopius was a relative of
Julian who had retired into private life, but
whom the jealousy of Valens had forced to
become a pretender. For awhile the danger was
pressing. Procopius had won over to his side some of
the best legions of the Empire, while his connexion
with the house of Constantine secured him the formidable
services of the Goths. But the great generals
kept their faith to Valens, and the usurper's power
melted away before them. A decisive battle at Nacolia
in Phrygia (May 366) once more seated Valens firmly
on his throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baptism of
Valens by Eudoxius
(367).</div>

<p>Events could scarcely have fallen out better for
Eudoxius and his friends. Valens was already on
their side, and now his zeal was quickened by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
mortal terror he had undergone, perhaps also by
shame at the unworthy panic in which he had already
allowed the exiles to return. In an age
when the larger number of professing Christians
were content to spend most of their
lives as catechumens, it was a decided step for an
Emperor to come forward and ask for baptism. This,
however, was the step taken by Valens in the spring
of 367, which finally committed him to the Hom&oelig;an
side. By it he undertook to resume the policy of Constantius,
and to drive out false teachers at the dictation
of Eudoxius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interval in the
controversy
(366-371).</div>

<p>The Semiarians were in no condition to resist. Their
district had been the seat of the revolt, and their disgrace
at court was not lessened by the embassy
to Rome. So divided also were they,
that while one party assembled a synod at
Tyana to welcome the return of the envoys, another
met in Caria to ratify the Lucianic creed again. Unfortunately
however for Eudoxius, Valens was entangled
in a war with the Goths for three campaigns, and
afterwards detained for another year in the Hellespontine
district, so that he could not revisit the East till
the summer of 371. Meanwhile there was not much
to be done. Athanasius had been formally restored to
his church during the Procopian panic by Brasidas
the notary (February 366), and was too strong to be
molested again. Meletius also and others had been
allowed to return at the same time, and Valens was
too busy to disturb them. Thus there was a sort of
truce for the next few years. Of Syria we hear
scarcely anything; and even in Pontus the strife must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
have been abated by the famine of 368. The little
we find to record seems to belong to the year 367.
On one side, Eunomius the Anom&oelig;an was sent into
exile, but soon recalled on the intercession of the old
Arian Valens of Mursa. On the other, the Semiarians
were not allowed to hold the great synod at Tarsus,
which was intended to complete their reconciliation
with the Western Nicenes. These years form the
third great break in the Arian controversy, and were
hardly less fruitful of results than the two former
breaks under Constantius and Julian. Let us therefore
glance at the condition of the churches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New Nicene
party in
Cappadocia</div>

<p>The Hom&oelig;an party was the last hope of Arianism
within the Empire. The original doctrine of Arius
had been decisively rejected at Nic&aelig;a; the
Eusebian coalition was broken up by the
Sirmian manifesto; and if the Hom&oelig;an
union also failed, the fall of Arianism could not be
long delayed. Its weakness is shown by the rise of a
new Nicene party in the most Arian province of the
Empire. Cappadocia is an exception to the general
rule that Christianity flourished best where cities were
most numerous. The polished vice of Antioch or
Corinth presented fewer obstacles than the rude ignorance
of <i>pagi</i> or country villages. Now Cappadocia was
chiefly a country district. The walls of C&aelig;sarea lay
in ruins since its capture by the Persians in the reign
of Gallienus, and the other towns of the province were
small and few. Yet Julian found it incorrigibly
Christian, and we hear but little of heathenism from
Basil. We cannot suppose that the Cappadocian
boors were civilized enough to be out of the reach of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
heathen influence. It seems rather that the <i>paganismus</i>
of the West was partly represented by Arianism. In
Cappadocia the heresy found its first great literary
champion in the sophist Asterius. Gregory and
George were brought to Alexandria from Cappadocia,
and afterwards Auxentius to Milan and Eudoxius to
Constantinople. Philagrius also, the prefect who
drove out Athanasius in 339, was another of their
countrymen. Above all, the heresiarch Eunomius
came from Cappadocia, and had abundance of admirers
in his native district. In this old Arian stronghold
the league was formed which decided the fate of
Arianism. Earnest men like Meletius had only been
attracted to the Hom&oelig;ans by their professions of
reverence for the person of the Lord. When, therefore,
it appeared that Eudoxius and his friends were
no better than Arians after all, these men began to
look back to the decisions of 'the great and holy
council' of Nic&aelig;a. There, at any rate, they would
find something independent of the eunuchs and cooks
who ruled the palace. Of the old conservatives also,
who were strong in Pontus, there were many who felt
that the Semiarian position was unsound, and yet
could find no satisfaction in the indefinite doctrine
professed at court. Here then was one split in the
Hom&oelig;an, another in the conservative party. If only
the two sets of malcontents could form a union with
each other and with the older Nicenes of Egypt and
the West, they would sooner or later be the arbiters
of Christendom. If they could secure Valentinian's
intercession, they might obtain religious freedom at
once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Basil of C&aelig;sarea.</div>

<p>Such seems to have been the plan laid down by
the man who was now succeeding Athanasius as leader
of the Nicene party. Basil of C&aelig;sarea was
a disciple of the schools of Athens, and a
master of heathen eloquence and learning. He was
also man of the world enough to keep on friendly
terms with men of all sorts. Amongst his friends we
find Athanasius and Gregory of Nazianzus, Libanius the
heathen rhetorician, the barbarian generals Arinth&aelig;us
and Victor, the renegade Modestus, and the Arian
bishop Euippius. He was a Christian also of a Christian
family. His grandmother, Macrina, was one of
those who fled to the woods in the time of Diocletian's
persecution; and in after years young Basil learned
from her the words of Gregory the Wonder worker.
The connections of his early life were with the conservatives.
He owed his baptism to Dianius of
C&aelig;sarea, and much encouragement in asceticism to
Eustathius of Sebastia. In 359 he accompanied Basil
of Ancyra from Seleucia to the conferences at Constantinople,
and on his return home came forward as a
resolute enemy of Arianism at C&aelig;sarea. The young
deacon was soon recognised as a power in Asia. He
received the dying recantation of Dianius, and guided
the choice of his successor Eusebius in 362. Yet he
still acted with the Semiarians, and helped them with
his counsel at Lampsacus. Indeed it was from the
Semiarian side that he approached the Nicene faith.
In his own city of C&aelig;sarea Eusebius found him indispensable.
When jealousies arose between them,
and Basil withdrew to his rustic paradise in Pontus,
he was recalled by the clamour of the people at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
approach of Valens in 365. This time the danger
was averted by the Procopian troubles, but henceforth
Basil governed Eusebius, and the church of C&aelig;sarea
through him, till in the summer of 370 he succeeded
to the bishopric himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Basil bishop
of C&aelig;sarea.</div>

<p>The election was a critical one, for every one knew
that a bishop like Basil would be a pillar of the
Nicene cause. On one side were the officials
and the lukewarm bishops, on the other the
people and the better class of Semiarians. They had
to make great efforts. Eusebius of Samosata came
to C&aelig;sarea to urge the wavering bishops, and old
Gregory<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was carried from Nazianzus on his litter
to perform the consecration. There was none but
Basil who could meet the coming danger. By the
spring of 371 Valens had fairly started on his progress
to the East. He travelled slowly through the famine-wasted
provinces, and only reached C&aelig;sarea in time
for the great winter festival of Epiphany 372. The
Nicene faith in Cappadocia was not the least of the
abuses he was putting down. The bishops yielded in
all directions, but Basil was unshaken. The rough
threats of Modestus succeeded no better than the
fatherly counsel of Euippius; and when Valens himself
and Basil met face to face, the Emperor was
overawed. More than once the order was prepared for
the obstinate prelate's exile, but for one reason or
another it was never issued. Valens went forward
on his journey, leaving behind a princely gift for
Basil's poorhouse. He reached Antioch in April, and
settled there for the rest of his reign, never again
leaving Syria till the disasters of the Gothic war called
him back to Eu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>rope.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_15" id="Footnote_1_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_15"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The father of Gregory of Nazianzus the Divine, who was bishop, as
we shall see, of Sasima and Constantinople in succession, but never
of Nazianzus.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Basil's difficulties.</div>

<p>Armed with spiritual power which in some sort
extended from the Bosphorus to Armenia, Basil could
now endeavour to carry out his plan.
Hom&oelig;an malcontents formed the nucleus
of the league, but conservatives began to join it, and
Athanasius gave his patriarchal blessing to the scheme.
The difficulties, however, were very great. The league
was full of jealousies. Athanasius indeed might
frankly recognise the soundness of Meletius, though
he was committed to Paulinus, but others were less
liberal, and Lucifer of Calaris was forming a schism on
the question. Some, again, were lukewarm in the
cause and many sunk in worldliness, while others were
easily diverted from their purpose. The sorest trial of
all was the selfish coldness of the West. Basil might
find here and there a kindred spirit like Ambrose
of Milan after 374; but the confessors of 355 were
mostly gathered to their rest, and the church of Rome
paid no regard to sufferings which were not likely to
reach herself.</p>

<p>Nor was Basil quite the man for such a task as
this. His courage indeed was indomitable. He ruled
Cappadocia from a sick-bed, and bore down opposition
by sheer strength of his inflexible determination. The
very pride with which his enemies reproached him was
often no more than a strong man's consciousness of
power; and to this unwearied energy he joined an
ascetic fervour which secured the devotion of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
friends, a knowledge of the world which often turned
aside the fury of his enemies, and a flow of warm-hearted
rhetoric which never failed to command the
admiration of outsiders. Yet after all we miss the lofty
self-respect which marks the later years of Athanasius.
Basil was involved in constant difficulties by his own
pride and suspicion. We cannot, for example, imagine
Athanasius turning two presbyters out of doors as
'spies.' But the ascetic is usually too full of his own
plans to feel sympathy with others, too much in earnest
to feign it like a diplomatist. Basil had enough
worldly prudence to keep in the background his belief
in the Holy Spirit, but not enough to protect even
his closest friends from the outbreaks of his imperious
temper. Small wonder if the great scheme met with
many difficulties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disputes with:
(1.) Anthimus.</div>

<p>A specimen or two may be given, from which it will
be seen that the difficulties were not all of Basil's
making. When Valens divided Cappadocia
in 372, the capital of the new province was
fixed at Tyana. Thereupon Bishop Anthimus argued
that ecclesiastical arrangements necessarily follow civil,
and claimed the obedience of its bishops as due to
him and not to Basil. Peace was patched up after
an unseemly quarrel, and Basil disposed of any future
claims from Anthimus by getting the new capital transferred
to Podandus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) Eustathius.</div>

<p>The dispute with Anthimus was little more than a
personal quarrel, so that it was soon forgotten. The
old Semiarian Eustathius of Sebastia was
able to give more serious annoyance. He
was a man too active to be ignored, too unstable to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
trusted, too famous for ascetic piety to be lightly made
an open enemy. His friendship was compromising,
his enmity dangerous. We left him professing the
Nicene faith before the council of Tyana. For the
next three years we lose sight of him. He reappears
as a friend of Basil in 370, and heartily supported
him in his strife with Valens. Eustathius was at any
rate no time-server. He was drawn to Basil by old
friendship and a common love of asceticism, but almost
equally repelled by the imperious orthodoxy of a stronger
will than his own. And Basil for a long time clung
to his old teacher, though the increasing distrust of
staunch Nicenes like Theodotus of Nicopolis was
beginning to attack himself. His peacemaking was
worse than a failure. First he offended Theodotus,
then he alienated Eustathius. The suspicious zeal of
Theodotus was quieted in course of time, but Eustathius
never forgave the urgency which wrung from him his
signature to a Nicene confession. He had long been
leaning the other way, and now he turned on Basil
with all the bitterness of broken friendship. To such
a man the elastic faith of the Hom&oelig;ans was a welcome
refuge. If they wasted little courtesy on their convert,
they did not press him to strain his conscience by
signing what he ought not to have signed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apollinarius
of Laodicea.</div>

<p>The Arian controversy was exhausted for the present,
and new questions were already beginning to take its
place. While Basil and Eustathius were
preparing the victory of asceticism in the
next generation, Apollinarius had already essayed the
christological problem of Ephesus and Chalcedon;
and Apollinarius was no common thinker. If his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
efforts were premature, he at least struck out the most
suggestive of the ancient heresies. Both in what he
saw and in what he failed to see, his work is full of
meaning for our own time. Apollinarius and his
father were Christian literary men of Laodicea in
Syria, and stood well to the front of controversy in
Julian's days. When the rescript came out which
forbade the Galileans to teach the classics, they
promptly undertook to form a Christian literature by
throwing Scripture into classical forms. The Old
Testament was turned into Homeric verse, the New into
Platonic dialogues. Here again Apollinarius was premature.
There was indeed no reason why Christianity
should not have as good a literature as heathenism,
but it would have to be a growth of many ages.
In doctrine Apollinarius was a staunch Nicene, and
one of the chief allies of Athanasius in Syria. But
he was a Nicene of an unusual type, for the side of
Arianism which specially attracted his attention was
its denial of the Lord's true manhood. It will be
remembered that according to Arius the created Word
assumed human flesh and nothing more. Eustathius
of Antioch had long ago pointed out the error, and
the Nicene council shut it out by adding <i>was made
man</i> to the <i>was made flesh</i> of the C&aelig;sarean creed. It
was thus agreed that the lower element in the incarnation
was man, not mere flesh; in other words, the
Lord was perfect man as well as perfect God. But
in that case, how can God and man form one person?
In particular, the freedom of his human will is inconsistent
with the fixity of the divine. Without free-will
he was not truly man; yet free-will always leads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
to sin. If all men are sinners, and the Lord was not
a sinner, it seemed to follow that he was not true man
like other men. Yet in that case the incarnation is a
mere illusion. The difficulty was more than Athanasius
himself could fully solve. All that he could do
was to hold firmly the doctrine of the Lord's true manhood
as declared by Scripture, and leave the question
of his free-will for another age to answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Apollinarian
system.</div>

<p>The analysis of human nature which we find in
Scripture is twofold. In many passages there is a
moral division into the spirit and the flesh&mdash;all
that draws us up towards heaven and
all that draws us down to earth. It must be carefully
noted (what ascetics of all ages have overlooked) that
the flesh is not the body. Envy and hatred are just
as much works of the flesh<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as revelling and uncleanness.
It is not the body which lusts against the
soul, but the evil nature running through them both
which refuses the leading of the Spirit of God. But
these are practical statements: the proper psychology
of Scripture is given in another series of passages. It
comes out clearly in 1 Thess. v. 23&mdash;'your whole
spirit, and soul, and body be preserved blameless unto
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.' Here the
division is threefold. The body we know pretty well,
as far as concerns its material form. The soul however,
is not the 'soul' of common language. It is
only the seat of the animal life which we share with
the beasts. Above the soul, beyond the ken of
Aristotle, Scripture reveals the spirit as the seat of
the immortal life which is to pass the gate of death
unharmed. Now it is one chief merit of Apollinarius
(and herein he has the advan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>tage over Athanasius)
that he based his system on the true psychology of
Scripture. He argued that sin reaches man through
the will, whose seat is in the spirit. Choice for good
or for evil is in the will. Hence Adam fell through
the weakness of the spirit. Had that been stronger,
he would have been able to resist temptation. So it
is with the rest of us: we all sin through the weakness
of the spirit. If then the Lord was a man in whom
the mutable human spirit was replaced by the immutable
Divine Word, there will be no difficulty in
understanding how he could be free from sin. Apollinarius,
however, rightly chose to state his theory the
other way&mdash;that the Divine Word assumed a human
body and a human soul, and himself took the place of
a human spirit. So far we see no great advance on the
Arian theory of the incarnation. If the Lord had no
true human spirit, he is no more true man than if he
had nothing human but the body. We get a better
explanation of his sinlessness, but we still get it at the
expense of his humanity. In one respect the Arians
had the advantage. Their created Word is easier
joined with human flesh than the Divine Word with a
human body and a human soul. At this point, however,
Apollinarius introduced a thought of deep significance&mdash;that
the spirit in Christ was human spirit,
although divine. If man was made in the image of
God, the Divine Word is not foreign to that human
spirit which is in his likeness, but is rather the true
perfection of its image. If, therefore, the Lord had
the divine Word instead of the human spirit of other
men, he is not the less human, but the more so for the
difference. Furthermore, the Word which in Christ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
was human spirit was eternal. Apart then from the
incarnation, the Word was archetypal man as well as
God. Thus we reach the still more solemn thought
that the incarnation is not a mere expedient to get
rid of sin, but the historic revelation of what was latent
in the Word from all eternity. Had man not sinned,
the Word must still have come among us, albeit not
through shame and death. It was his nature that he
should come. If he was man from eternity, it was
his nature to become in time like men on earth,
and it is his nature to remain for ever man. And
as the Word looked down on mankind, so mankind
looked upward to the Word. The spirit in man is a
frail and shadowy thing apart from Christ, and men
are not true men till they have found in him their
immutable and sovereign guide. Thus the Word and
man do not confront each other as alien beings. They
are joined together in their inmost nature, and (may
we say it?) each receives completion from the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Criticism of
Apollinarianism.</div>

<p>The system of Apollinarius is a mighty outline whose
details we can hardly even now fill in; yet as a system
it is certainly a failure. His own contemporaries
may have done him something less
than justice, but they could not follow his
daring flights of thought when they saw plain errors
in his teaching. After all, Apollinarius reaches no true
incarnation. The Lord is something very like us, but
he is not one of us. The spirit is surely an essential
part of man, and without a true human spirit he could
have no true human choice or growth or life; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
indeed Apollinarius could not allow him any. His
work is curtailed also like his manhood, for (so Gregory
of Nyssa put it) the spirit which the Lord did not
assume is not redeemed. Apollinarius understood even
better than Athanasius the kinship of true human
nature to its Lord, and applied it with admirable skill
to explain the incarnation as the expression of the
eternal divine nature. But he did not see so well as
Athanasius that sin is a mere intruder among men. It
was not a hopeful age in which he lived. The world
had gone a long way downhill since young Athanasius
had sung his song of triumph over fallen heathenism.
Roman vice and Syrian frivolity, Eastern asceticism
and Western legalism, combined to preach, in spite of
Christianity, that the sinfulness of mankind is essential.
So instead of following out the pregnant hint of Athanasius
that sin is no true part of human nature (else
were God the author of evil), Apollinarius cut the knot
by refusing the Son of Man a human spirit as a thing
of necessity sinful. Too thoughtful to slur over the
difficulty like Pelagius, he was yet too timid to realize
the possibility of a conquest of sin by man, even
though that man were Christ himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Apollinarians.</div>

<p>Apollinarius and his school contributed not a little
to the doctrinal confusion of the East. His ideas were
current for some time in various forms, and
are attacked in some of the later works of
Athanasius; but it was not till about 375 that they
led to a definite schism, marked by the consecration
of the presbyter Vitalis to the bishopric of Antioch.
From this time, Apollinarian bishops disputed many of
the Syrian sees with Nicenes and Anom&oelig;ans. Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
adherents were also scattered over Asia, and supplied
one more element of discord to the noisy populace of
Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Last years of
Athanasius
(366-373).</div>

<p>The declining years of Athanasius were spent in
peace. Valens had restored him in good faith, and
never afterwards molested him. If Lucius
the Arian returned to Alexandria to try
his chance as bishop, the officials gave him
no connivance&mdash;nothing but sorely needed shelter from
the fury of the mob. Arianism was nearly extinct in
Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Athanasius
and Marcellus
(before 371).</div>

<p>One of his last public acts was to receive an embassy
from Marcellus, who was still living in extreme old
age at Ancyra. Some short time before
371, the deacon Eugenius presented to
him a confession on behalf of the 'innumerable
multitude' who still owned Marcellus for their
father. 'We are not heretics, as we are slandered.
We specially anathematize Arianism, confessing, like
our fathers at Nic&aelig;a, that the Son is no creature, but
of the essence of the Father and co-essential with the
Father; and by the Son we mean no other than
the Word. Next we anathematize Sabellius, for we
confess the eternity and reality of the Son and the
Holy Spirit. We anathematize also the Anom&oelig;ans,
in spite of their pretence not to be Arians. We
anathematize finally the Arianizers who separate the
Word from the Son, giving the latter a beginning at
the incarnation because they do not confess him to
be very God. Our own doctrine of the incarnation
is that the Word did not come down as on the prophets,
but truly became flesh and took a servant's form, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
as regards flesh was born as a man.' There is no
departure here from the original doctrine of Marcellus,
for the eternity of the Son means nothing more than
the eternity of the Word. The memorial, however,
was successful. Though Athanasius was no Marcellian,
he was as determined as ever to leave all questions
open which the great council had forborne to close.
The new Nicenes of Pontus, on the other hand,
inherited the conservative dread of Marcellus, so that
it was a sore trial to Basil when Athanasius refused
to sacrifice the old companion of his exile. Even the
great Alexandrian's comprehensive charity is hardly
nobler than his faithfulness to erring friends. Meaner
men might cherish the petty jealousies of controversy,
but the veterans of the great council once more recognised
their fellowship in Christ. They were joined in
life, and in death they were not divided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Athanasius
(373).</div>

<p>Marcellus passed away in 371, and Athanasius two
years later. The victory was not yet won, the goal of
half a century was still beyond the sight
of men; yet Athanasius had conquered
Arianism. Of his greatness we need say no more.
Some will murmur of 'fanaticism' before the only
Christian whose grandeur awed the scoffer Gibbon.
So be it that his greatness was not unmixed with
human passion; but those of us who have seen the
light of heaven shining from some saintly face, or
watched with kindling hearts and solemn thankfulness
some mighty victory of Christian faith, will surely know
that it was the spirit of another world which dwelt in
Athanasius. To him more than any one we owe it
that the question of Arianism did not lose itself in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
personalities and quibbles, but took its proper place
as a battle for the central message of the gospel,
which is its chief distinction from philosophy and
heathenism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extinction of
the Marcellians
(375).</div>

<p>Instantly Alexandria was given up to the Arians,
and Lucius repeated the outrages of Gregory and
George. The friends of Athanasius were
exiled, and his successor Peter fled to Rome.
Meanwhile the school of Marcellus died
away. In 375 his surviving followers addressed a
new memorial to the Egyptian exiles at Sepphoris,
in which they plainly confessed the eternal Sonship
so long evaded by their master. Basil took no small
offence when the exiles accepted the memorial. 'They
were not the only zealous defenders of the Nicene
faith in the East, and should not have acted without
the consent of the Westerns and of their own bishop,
Peter. In their haste to heal one schism they might
cause another if they did not make it clear that the
heretics had come over to them, and not they to the
heretics.' This, however, was mere grumbling. Now
that the Marcellians had given up the point in dispute,
there was no great difficulty about their formal reconciliation.
The West held out for Marcellus after
his own disciples had forsaken him, so that he was
not condemned at Rome till 380, nor by name till
381.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion of:
(1) Churches.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the churches of Asia seemed in a state
of universal dissolution. Disorder under Constantius
had become confusion worse confounded
under Valens. The exiled bishops were
so many centres of disaffection, and personal quarrels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
had full scope everywhere. Thus when Basil's brother
Gregory was expelled from Nyssa by a riot got up
by Anthimus of Tyana, he took refuge under the eyes
of Anthimus at Doara, where a similar riot had
driven out the Arian bishop. Pastoral work was
carried on under the greatest difficulties. The exiles
could not attend to their churches, the schemers would
not, and the fever of controversy was steadily demoralizing
both flocks and pastors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2.) Creeds.</div>

<p>Creeds were in the same confusion. The Hom&oelig;ans
as a body had no consistent principle at all beyond
the rejection of technical terms, so that their
doctrinal statements are very miscellaneous.
They began with the indefinite Sirmian creed, but
the confession they imposed on Eustathius of Sebastia
was purely Macedonian. Some of their bishops were
Nicenes, others Anom&oelig;ans. There was room for all
in the happy family presided over by Eudoxius and his
successor Demophilus. In this anarchy of doctrine,
the growth of irreligious carelessness kept pace with
that of party bitterness. Ecclesiastical history records
no clearer period of decline than this. There is a
plain descent from Athanasius to Basil, a rapid one
from Basil to Theophilus and Cyril. The victors of Constantinople
are but the epigoni of a mighty contest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hopeful signs.</div>

<p>Hopeful signs indeed were not entirely wanting.
If the Nicene cause did not seem to gain much ground
in Pontus, it was at least not losing.
While Basil held the court in check, the
rising power of asceticism was declaring itself every
day more plainly on his side. One schism was healed
by the reception of the Marcellians; and if Apollinarius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
was forming another, he was at least a resolute enemy
of Arianism. The submission of the Lycian bishops
in 375 helped to isolate the Semiarian phalanx in
Asia, and the Illyrian council held in the same year
by Ambrose was the first effective help from the
West. It secured a rescript of Valentinian in favour
of the Nicenes; and if he did not long survive, his
action was enough to show that Valens might not
always be left to carry out his plans undisturbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>THE FALL OF ARIANISM.</i></h3>


<div class="sidenote">Prospects
in 375.</div>

<p>The fiftieth year from the great council came and
went, and brought no relief to the calamities of the
churches. Meletius and Cyril were still in
exile, East and West were still divided over
the consecration of Paulinus, and now even Alexandria
had become the prey of Lucius. The leaden rule of
Valens still weighed down the East, and Valens
was scarcely yet past middle life, and might reign
for many years longer. The deliverance came suddenly,
and the Nicene faith won its victory in the
confusion of the greatest disaster which had ever yet
befallen Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Empire
in 376.</div>

<p>In the year 376 the Empire still seemed to stand
unshaken within the limits of Augustus. If the legions
had retired from the outlying provinces of
Dacia and Carduene, they more than held
their ground on the great river frontiers of the Euphrates,
the Danube, and the Rhine. If Julian's death had
seemed to let loose all the enemies of Rome at once, they
had all been repulsed. While the Persian advance was
checked by the obstinate patriotism of Armenia, Valens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
reduced the Goths to submission, and his Western
colleague drove the Germans out of Gaul and recovered
Britain from the Picts. The Empire had fully held
its own through twelve years of incessant warfare;
and if there were serious indications of exhaustion in
the dwindling of the legions and the increase of the
barbarian auxiliaries, in the troops of brigands who
infested every mountain district, in the alarming decrease
of population, and above all in the ruin of the
provinces by excessive taxation, it still seemed inconceivable
that real danger could ever menace Rome's
eternal throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gothic
war (377-378).</div>

<p>But while the imperial statesmen were watching
the Euphrates, the storm was gathering on the Danube.
The Goths in Dacia had been learning husbandry
and Christianity since Aurelian's
time, and bade fair soon to become a civilized people.
Heathenism was already half abandoned, and their
nomad habits half laid aside. But when the Huns
came up suddenly from the steppes of Asia, the stately
Gothic warriors fled almost without a blow from the
hordes of wild dwarfish horsemen. The Ostrogoths
became the servants of their conquerors, and the
heathens of Athanaric found a refuge in the recesses
of the Transylvanian forests. But Fritigern was a
Christian. Rome had helped him once before, and
Rome might help him now. A whole nation of panic-stricken
warriors crowded to the banks of the Danube.
There was but one inviolable refuge in the world, and
that was beneath the shelter of the Roman eagles.
Only let them have some of the waste lands in Thrace,
and they would be glad to do the Empire faithful service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
When conditions had been settled, the Goths
were brought across the river. Once on Roman ground,
they were left to the mercy of officials whose only
thought was to make the famished barbarians a prey
to their own rapacity and lust. Before long the Goths
broke loose and spread over the country, destroying
whatever cultivation had survived the desolating misgovernment
of the Empire. Outlaws and deserters
were willing guides, and crowds of fresh barbarians
came in to share the spoil. The Roman generals found
it no easy task to keep the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of Hadrianople
(Aug. 9, 378).</div>

<p>First the victories of Claudius and Aurelian, and
then the statesmanship of Constantine, had stayed for a
century the tide of Northern war, but now
the Empire was again reduced to fight for
its existence. Its rulers seemed to understand
the crisis. The East was drained of all available
troops, and Sebastian the Manichee, the old enemy of
Athanasius, was placed in command. Gratian hurried
Thraceward with the Gaulish legions, and at last Valens
thought it time to leave his pleasant home at Antioch
for the field of war. Evil omens beset his march,
but no omen could be worse than his own impulsive
rashness. With a little prudence, such a force as he
had gathered round the walls of Hadrianople was an
overmatch for any hordes of barbarians. But Valens
determined to storm the Gothic camp without waiting
for his Western colleague. Rugged ground and tracts
of burning grass delayed his march, so that it was long
past noon before he neared the line of waggons, later
still before the Gothic trumpet sounded. But the
Roman army was in hopeless rout at sundown. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Goths came down 'like a thunderbolt on the mountain
tops,' and all was lost. Far into the night the
slaughtering went on. Sebastian fell, the Emperor
was never heard of more, and full two-thirds of the
Roman army perished in a scene of unequalled horror
since the butchery of Cann&aelig;.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of the
battle.</div>

<p>Beneath that crushing blow the everlasting Empire
shook from end to end. The whole power of the East
had been mustered with a painful effort to
the struggle, and the whole power of the
East had been shattered in a summer's day. For the
first time since the days of Gallienus, the Empire could
place no army in the field. But Claudius and Aurelian
had not fought in vain, nor were the hundred years of
respite lost. If the dominion of Western Europe was
transferred for ever to the Northern nations, the walls
of Constantinople had risen to bar their eastward
march, and Christianity had shown its power to awe
their boldest spirits. The Empire of the Christian
East withstood the shock of Hadrianople&mdash;only the
heathen West sank under it. When once the old
barriers of civilization on the Danube and the Rhine
were broken through, the barbarians poured in for
centuries like a flood of mighty waters overflowing.
Not till the Northman and the Magyar had found
their limit at the siege of Paris (888) and the
battle of the Lechfeld (955) could Europe feel
secure. The Roman Empire and the Christian Church
alone rode out the storm which overthrew the ancient
world. But the Christian Church was founded on
the ever-living Rock, the Roman Empire rooted deep
in history. Arianism was a thing of yesterday and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
had no principle of life, and therefore it vanished
in the crash of Hadrianople. The Hom&oelig;an supremacy
had come to rest almost wholly on imperial
misbelief. The mob of the capital might be in its
favour, and the virtues of isolated bishops might secure
it some support elsewhere; but serious men were
mostly Nicenes or Anom&oelig;ans. Demophilus of Constantinople
headed the party, and his blunders did it
almost as much harm as the profane jests of Eudoxius.
At Antioch Euzoius, the last of the early Arians, was
replaced by Dorotheus. Milan under Ambrose was
aggressively Nicene, and the Arian tyrants were very
weak at Alexandria. On the other hand, the greatest
of the Nicenes had passed away, and few were left who
could remember the great council's meeting. Athanasius
and Hilary were dead, and even Basil did not live
to greet an orthodox Emperor. Meletius of Antioch
was in exile, and Cyril of Jerusalem and the venerated
Eusebius of Samosata, while Gregory of Nazianzus had
found in the Isaurian mountains a welcome refuge from
his hated diocese of Sasima. If none of the living
Nicenes could pretend to rival Athanasius, they at least
outmatched the Arians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gratian's
toleration.</div>

<p>As Valens left no children, the Empire rested for the
moment in the hands of his nephew, Gratian, a youth
of not yet twenty. Gratian, however, was
wise enough to see that it was no time to
cultivate religious quarrels. He, therefore, began by
proclaiming toleration to all but Anom&oelig;ans and
Photinians. As toleration was still the theory of the
Empire, and none but the Nicenes were practically
molested, none but the Nicenes gained anything by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the edict. But mere toleration was all they needed.
The exiled bishops found little difficulty in resuming
the government of their flocks, and even in sending
missions to Arian strongholds. The Semiarians were
divided. Numbers went over to the Nicenes, while
others took up an independent or Macedonian position.
The Hom&oelig;an power in the provinces fell of itself
before it was touched by persecution. It scarcely even
struggled against its fate. At Jerusalem indeed party
spirit ran as high as ever, but Alexandria was given
up to Peter almost without resistance. We find one
or two outrages like the murder of Eusebius of
Samosata by an Arian woman in a country town, who
threw down a tile on his head, but we hardly ever find
a Hom&oelig;an bishop heartily supported by his flock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gregory of
Nazianzus.</div>

<p>
Constantinople itself was now the chief stronghold of
the Arians. They had held the churches since 340,
and were steadily supported by the court.
Thus the city populace was devoted to
Arianism, and the Nicenes were a mere remnant,
without either church or teacher. The time, however,
was now come for a mission to the capital. Gregory
of Nazianzus was the son of Bishop Gregory, born
about the time of the Nicene council. His father
was already presbyter of Nazianzus, and held the
bishopric for nearly half a century. (329-374.)
Young
Gregory was a student of many schools.
From the Cappadocian C&aelig;sarea he went on to the
Palestinian, and thence to Alexandria; but Athens
was the goal of his student-life. Gregory and Basil
and Prince Julian met at the feet of Pro&aelig;resius. They
all did credit to his eloquence, but there the likeness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
ends. Gregory disliked Julian's strange, excited
manner, and persuaded himself in later years that he
had even then foreseen the evil of the apostate's reign.
With Basil, on the other hand his friendship was for
life. They were well-matched in eloquence, in ascetic
zeal, and in opposition to Arianism, though Basil's
imperious ways were a trial to Gregory's gentler and
less active spirit. During the quarrel with Anthimus
of Tyana, Basil thought fit to secure the
disputed possession of Sasima by making
it a bishopric. (372.)
It was a miserable post-station&mdash;'No
water, no grass, nothing but dust and carts, and groans
and howls, and small officials with their usual instruments
of torture.' Gregory was made bishop of
Sasima against his will, and never fairly entered on
his repulsive duties. After a few years' retirement,
he came forward to undertake the mission
to Constantinople. (379.)
The great city was a
city of triflers. They jested at the actors and the
preachers without respect of persons, and followed
with equal eagerness the races and the theological
disputes. Anom&oelig;ans abounded in their noisy streets,
and the graver Novatians and Macedonians were
infected with the spirit of wrangling. Gregory's austere
character and simple life were in themselves a
severe rebuke to the lovers of pleasure round him.
He began his work in a private house, and only built
a church when the numbers of his flock increased.
He called it his Anastasia,&mdash;the church of the resurrection
of the faith. The mob was hostile&mdash;one night
they broke into his church&mdash;but the fruit of his labours
was a growing congregation of Nicenes in the capital.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Theodosius
Emperor in
the East (379).</div>

<p>Gratian's next step was to share his burden with a
colleague. If the care of the whole Empire had been
too much for Diocletian or Valentinian,
Gratian's were not the Atlantean shoulders
which could bear its undivided weight. In
the far West, at Cauca near Segovia, there lived a
son of Theodosius, the recoverer of Britain and Africa,
whose execution had so foully stained the opening of
Gratian's reign. That memory of blood was still fresh,
yet in that hour of overwhelming danger Gratian
called young Theodosius to be his honoured colleague
and deliverer. Early in 379 he gave him the conduct
of the Gothic war. With it went the Empire
of the East.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of the
Gothic war.</div>

<p>Theodosius was neither Greek nor Asiatic, but a
stranger from the Spanish West, endued with a full
measure of Spanish courage and intolerance.
As a general he was the most brilliant Rome
had seen since Julian's death. Men compared him to
Trajan, and in a happier age he might have rivalled
Trajan's fame. But now the Empire was ready to
perish. The beaten army was hopelessly demoralized,
and Theodosius had to form a new army of barbarian
legionaries before the old tradition of Roman superiority
could resume its wonted sway. It soon appeared that
the Goths could do nothing with their victory, and
sooner or later would have to make their peace with
Rome. Theodosius drove them inland in the first
campaign; and while he lay sick at Thessalonica in
the second, Gratian or his generals received the submission
of the Ostrogoths. Fritigern died the same
year, and his old rival Athanaric was a fugitive before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
it ended. When the returning Ostrogoths dislodged
him from his Transylvanian forest, he was welcomed
with honourable courtesy by Theodosius in person at
Constantinople. But the old enemy of Rome and
Christianity had only come to lay his bones on Roman
soil. In another fortnight the barbarian chief was
carried out with kingly splendour to his Roman funeral.
Theodosius had nobly won Athanaric's inheritance.
His wondering Goths at once took service with their
conqueror: chief after chief submitted, and the work
of peace was completed on the Danube in the autumn
of 382.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baptism of
Theodosius.</div>

<p>We can now return to ecclesiastical affairs. The
dangerous illness of Theodosius in 380 had important
consequences, for his baptism by Ascholius
of Thessalonica was the natural signal for a
more decided policy. Ascholius was a zealous Nicene,
so that Theodosius was committed to the Nicene side
as effectually as Valens had been to the Hom&oelig;an;
and Theodosius was less afraid of strong measures
than Valens. His first rescript (Feb. 27, 380) commands
all men to follow the Nicene doctrine 'committed
by the apostle Peter to the Romans, and now professed
by Damasus of Rome and Peter of Alexandria,' and
plainly threatens to impose temporal punishments on
the heretics. Here it will be seen that Theodosius
abandons Constantine's test of orthodoxy by subscription
to a creed. It seemed easier now, and more in the
spirit of Latin Christianity, to require communion with
certain churches. The choice of Rome is natural, the
addition of Alexandria shows that the Emperor was
still a stranger to the mysteries of Eastern partizanship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Suppression of Arian worship
inside cities.</div>

<p>There was no reason for delay when the worst
dangers of the Gothic war were over. Theodosius
made his formal entry into Constantinople,
November 24, 380, and at once required the
bishop either to accept the Nicene faith or
to leave the city. Demophilus honourably refused to
give up his heresy, and adjourned his services to the
suburbs. So ended the forty years of Arian domination
in Constantinople. But the mob was still Arian,
and their stormy demonstrations when the cathedral
of the Twelve Apostles was given up to Gregory of
Nazianzus were enough to make Theodosius waver.
Arian influence was still strong at court, and Arian
bishops came flocking to Constantinople. Low as
they had fallen, they could still count among them
the great name of Ulfilas. But he could give them
little help, for though the Goths of M&oelig;sia were faithful
to the Empire, Theodosius preferred the stalwart
heathens of Athanaric to their Arian countrymen.
Ulfilas died at Constantinople like Athanaric, but
there was no royal funeral for the first apostle of the
Northern nations. Theodosius hesitated, and even
consented to see the heresiarch Eunomius, who was
then living near Constantinople. The Nicenes took
alarm, and the Empress Flaccilla urged her husband on
the path of persecution. The next edict (Jan. 381)
forbade heretical discussions and assemblies inside cities,
and ordered the churches everywhere to be given up
to the Nicenes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Council of
Constantinople
(May 381).</div>

<p>Thus was Arianism put down, as it had been set
up, by the civil power. Nothing now remained but to
clear away the disorders which the strife had left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
behind. Once more an imperial summons went forth
for a council to meet at Constantinople in May 381.
It was a sombre gathering. The bright
hope which lighted the Empire at Nic&aelig;a had
long ago died out, and even the conquerors
now had no more joyous feeling than that of
thankfulness that the weary strife was coming to an
end. Only a hundred and fifty bishops were present,
all of them Easterns. The West was not represented
even by a Roman legate. Amongst them were Meletius
of Antioch, Gregory of Nyssa, Cyril of Jerusalem,
Gregory of Nazianzus as elect of Constantinople, and
Basil's unworthy successor, Helladius of C&aelig;sarea.
Timothy of Alexandria came later. The Semiarians
mustered thirty-six under Eleusius of Cyzicus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appointments
of Gregory,
Flavian, and
Nectarius.</div>

<p>The bishops were greeted with much splendour, and
received a truly imperial welcome in the form of a new
edict of persecution against the Manichees.
Meletius of Antioch presided in the council,
and Paulinus was ignored. Theodosius was
no longer neutral between Constantinople and Alexandria.
The Egyptians were not invited to the earlier
sittings, or at least were not present. The first act of
the assembly was to ratify the choice of Gregory of
Nazianzus as bishop of Constantinople. Meletius died
as they were coming to discuss the affairs of Antioch,
and Gregory took his place as president. Here was
an excellent chance of putting an end to the schism,
for Paulinus and Meletius had agreed that on the death
of either of them, the survivor should be recognised
by both parties as bishop of Antioch. But the council
was jealous of Paulinus and his Western friends, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
broke the agreement by appointing Flavian, one of
the presbyters who had sworn to refuse the office.
Gregory's remonstrance against this breach of faith
only drew upon him the hatred of the Eastern bishops.
The Egyptians, on the other hand, were glad to join
any attack on a nominee of Meletius, and found an
obsolete Nicene canon to invalidate his translation from
Sasima to Constantinople. Both parties were thus
agreed for evil. Gregory cared not to dispute with
them, but gave up his beloved Anastasia, and retired
to end his days at Nazianzus. The council was not
worthy of him. His successor was another sort of
man. Nectarius, the pr&aelig;tor of Constantinople, was a
man of the world of dignified presence, but neither
saint nor student. Him, however, Theodosius chose
to fill the vacant see, and under his guidance the
council finished its sessions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Retirement of
the Semiarians.</div>

<p>The next move was to find out whether the Semiarians
were willing to share the victory of the Nicenes.
As they were still a strong party round the
Hellespont, their friendship was important.
Theodosius also was less of a zealot than some of his
admirers imagine. The sincerity of his desire to conciliate
Eleusius is fairly guaranteed by his effort two
years later to find a scheme of comprehension even for
the Anom&oelig;ans. But the old soldier was not to be
tempted by hopes of imperial favour. However he
might oppose the Anom&oelig;ans, he could not forgive the
Nicenes their inclusion of the Holy Spirit in the sphere
of co-essential deity. Those of the Semiarians who
were willing to join the Nicenes had already done so,
and the rest were obstinate. They withdrew from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
council and gave up their churches like the Arians.
They comforted themselves with those words of Scripture,
'The churchmen are many, but the elect are few.'<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Close of the
council.</div>

<p>Whatever jealousies might divide the conquerors,
the Arian contest was now at an end. Pontus and
Syria were still divided from Rome and
Egypt on the question of Flavian's appointment,
and there were the germs of many future troubles
in the disposition of Alexandria to look for help to
Rome against the upstart see of Constantinople; but
against Arianism the council was united. Its first
canon is a solemn ratification of the Nicene creed in
its original shape, with a formal condemnation of all
the heresies, 'and specially those of the Eunomians or
Anom&oelig;ans, of the Arians or Eudoxians (<i>Hom&oelig;ans</i>), of
the Semiarians or Pneumatomachi; of the Sabellians,
Marcellians, Photinians, and Apollinarians.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">The spurious
Nicene creed.</div>

<p>The bishops issued no new creed. Tradition indeed
ascribes to them the spurious Nicene creed of our
Communion Service, with the exception of
two later insertions&mdash;the clause 'God of
God,' and the procession of the Holy Spirit 'from the
Son' as well as 'from the Father.' The story is an
old one, for it can be traced back to one of the
speakers at the council of Chalcedon in 451. It
caused some surprise at the time, but was afterwards
accepted. Yet it is beyond all question false. This
is shown by four convergent lines of argument. In
the first place, (1.) it is <i>a priori</i> unlikely. The
Athanasian party had been contending all along, not
vaguely for the Nicene doctrine, but for the Nicene
creed, the whole Nicene creed, and nothing but the
Nicene creed. Athanasius re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>fused to touch it at Sardica
in 343, refused again at Alexandria in 362, and
to the end of his life refused to admit that it was
in any way defective. Basil himself as late as 377
declined even to consider some additions to the incarnation
proposed to him by Epiphanius of Salamis. Is
it likely that their followers would straightway revise
the creed the instant they got the upper hand in 381?
And such a revision! The elaborate framework of
Nic&aelig;a is completely shattered, and even the keystone
clause 'of the essence of the Father' is left out.
Moreover, (2.) there is no contemporary evidence that
they did revise it. No historian mentions anything
of the sort, and no single document connected with
the council gives the slightest colour to the story.
There is neither trace nor sign of it for nearly seventy
years. The internal evidence (3.) points the same
way. Deliberate revision implies a deliberate purpose
to the alterations made. Now in this case, though we
have serious variations enough, there is another class
of differences so meaningless that they cannot even be
represented in an English translation. There remains
(4.) one more argument. The spurious Nicene creed
cannot be the work of the fathers of Constantinople in
381, because it is given in the <i>Ancoratus</i> of Epiphanius,
which was certainly written in 374. But if the council
did not draw up the creed, it is time to ask who
did. Everything seems to show that it is not a
revision of the Nicene creed at all, but of the local
creed of Jerusalem, executed by Bishop Cyril on his
return from exile in 362. This is only a theory, but
it has all the evidence which a theory can have&mdash;it
explains the whole matter. In the first place, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
meaningless changes disappear if we compare the
spurious Nicene creed with that of Jerusalem instead
of the genuine Nicene. Every difference can be
accounted for by reference to the known position and
opinions of Cyril. Thus the old Jerusalem creed says
that the Lord '<i>sat</i> down at the right hand of the
Father;' our 'Nicene,' that he '<i>sitteth</i>.' Now this is
a favourite point of Cyril in his <i>Catecheses</i>&mdash;that the
Lord did not sit down once for all, but that he sitteth
so for ever. Similarly other points. We also know
that other local creeds were revised about the same
time and in the same way. In the next place, the
occurrence of a revised Jerusalem creed in the <i>Ancoratus</i>
is natural. Epiphanius was past middle life when he
left Palestine for Cyprus in 368, and never forgot the
friends he left behind at Lydda. We are also in a
position to account for its ascription to the council of
Constantinople. Cyril's was a troubled life, and there
are many indications that he was accused of heresy in
381, and triumphantly acquitted by the council. In
such a case his creed would naturally be examined and
approved. It was a sound confession, and in no way
heretical. From this point its history is clearer. The
authority of Jerusalem combined with its own intrinsic
merits to recommend it, and the incidental approval of
the bishops at Constantinople was gradually developed
into the legend of their authorship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rest of
the canons.</div>

<p>The remaining canons are mostly aimed at the
disorders which had grown up during the reign of
Valens. One of them checks the reckless accusations
which were brought against the bishops by ordering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
that no charge of heresy should be received from heretics
and such like. Such a disqualification of
accusers was not unreasonable, as it did not
apply to charges of private wrong; yet this clerical
privilege grew into one of the worst scandals of the
Middle Ages. The forged decretals of the ninth century
not only order the strictest scrutiny of witnesses against
a bishop, but require seventy-two of them to convict
him of any crime <i>except</i> heresy. Another canon forbids
the intrusion of bishops into other dioceses. 'Nevertheless,
the bishop of Constantinople shall hold the
first rank after the bishop of Rome, because Constantinople
is New Rome.' This is the famous third canon,
which laid a foundation for the ecclesiastical authority
of Constantinople. It was extended at Chalcedon (451) into
a jurisdiction over the whole country from
Mount Taurus to the Danube, and by
Justinian into the supremacy of the East. The canon,
therefore, marks a clear step in the concentration of
the Eastern Church and Empire round Constantinople.
The blow struck Rome on one side, Alexandria on the
other. It was the reason why Rome withheld for
centuries her full approval from the council of Constantinople. (1215.)
She could not safely give it
till her Eastern rival was humiliated; and
this was not till the time of the Latin Emperors in the
thirteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second edict defining orthodoxy.</div>

<p>The council having ratified the Emperor's work, it
only remained for the Emperor to complete that of the
council. A new edict in July forbade Arians of every
sort to build churches. Even their old liberty to build
outside the walls of cities was now taken from them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
At the end of the month Theodosius issued an amended
definition of orthodoxy. Henceforth sound
belief was to be guaranteed by communion,
no longer with Rome and Alexandria, but
with Constantinople, Alexandria, and the chief bishoprics
of the East. The choice of bishops was decided
partly by their own importance, partly by that of their
sees. Gregory of Nyssa may represent one class,
Helladius of C&aelig;sarea the other. The omissions, however,
are significant. We miss not only Antioch and
Jerusalem, but Ephesus and Hadrianople, and even
Nicomedia. There is a broad space left clear around
the Bosphorus. If we now take into account the
third canon, we cannot mistake the Asiatic policy of
endeavouring to replace the primacy of Rome or
Alexandria by that of Constantinople.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Novatians.</div>

<p>The tolerance of Theodosius was a little, though
only a little, wider than it seems. Though the
Novatians were not in communion with
Nectarius, they were during the next half
century a recognised exception to the persecuting
laws. They had always been sound as against
Arianism, and their bishop Agelius had suffered
exile under Valens. His confession was approved by
Theodosius, and several of his successors lived on
friendly terms with liberal or worldly patriarchs like
Nectarius and Atticus. They suffered something from
the bigotry of Chrysostom, something also from the
greed of Cyril, but for them the age of persecution only
began with Nestorius in 428.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decay of
Arianism.</div>

<p>So far as numbers went, the cause of Arianism was
not even yet hopeless. It was still fairly strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> in
Syria and Asia, and counted adherents as far west as the
banks of the Danube. At Constantinople it could raise
dangerous riots (in one of them Nectarius
had his house burnt), and even at the court
of Milan it had a powerful supporter in Valentinian's
widow, the Empress Justina. Yet its fate was none the
less a mere question of time. Its cold logic generated
no such fiery enthusiasm as sustained the African
Donatists; the newness of its origin allowed no venerable
traditions to grow up round it like those of heathenism,
while its imperial claims and past successes cut it off
from the appeal of later heresies to provincial separatism.
When, therefore, the last overtures of Theodosius
fell through in 383, the heresy was quite unable to bear
the strain of steady persecution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Teutonic
Arianism: (1.)
In the East.</div>

<p>But if Arianism soon ceased to be a power inside
the Empire, it remained the faith of the barbarian
invaders. The work of Ulfilas was not in
vain. Not the Goths only, but all the
earlier Teutonic converts were Arians. And
the Goths had a narrow miss of empire. The
victories of Theodosius were won by Gothic strength.
It was the Goths who scattered the mutineers of Britain,
and triumphantly scaled the impregnable
walls of Aquileia; (388)
the Goths who won the
hardest battle of the century, and saw the Franks
themselves go down before them on the
Frigidus. (394)
The Goths of Alaric plundered
Rome itself; the Goths of Ga&iuml;nas entered Constantinople,
though only to be overwhelmed and slaughtered
round the vain asylum of their burning church.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">(2.) In the
West.</div>

<p>In the next century the Teutonic conquest of the
West gave Arianism another lease of power. Once
more the heresy was supreme in Italy, and
Spain, and Africa. Once more it held and
lost the future of the world. To the barbarian as well
as to the heathen it was a half-way halt upon the road to
Christianity; and to the barbarian also it was nothing
but a source of weakness. It lived on and in its
turn perpetuated the feud between the Roman and the
Teuton which caused the destruction of the earlier
Teutonic kingdoms in Western Europe. The provincials
or their children might forget the wrongs of
conquest, but heresy was a standing insult to the
Roman world. Theodoric the Ostrogoth may rank
with the greatest statesmen of the Empire, yet even
Theodoric found his Arianism a fatal disadvantage.
And if the isolation of heresy fostered the beginnings
of a native literature, it also blighted every hope of
future growth. The Goths were not inferior to the
English, but there is nothing in Gothic history like
the wonderful burst of power which followed the conversion
of the English. There is no Gothic writer to
compare with Bede or C&aelig;dmon. Jordanis is not much to
set against them, and even Jordanis was not an Arian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of
Teutonic
Arianism.</div>

<p>The sword of Belisarius did but lay open the
internal disunion of Italy and Africa. A single blow
destroyed the kingdom of the Vandals, and
all the valour of the Ostrogoths could only
win for theirs a downfall of heroic grandeur.
Sooner or later every Arian nation had to purge itself
of heresy or vanish from the earth. Even
the distant Visigoths (589) were
forced to see
that Arians could <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>not hold Spain. The Lombards in
Italy were the last defenders of the hopeless cause,
and they too yielded a few years later to the efforts
of Pope Gregory and Queen Theudelinda. (599)
Of Continental Teutons, the Franks alone
escaped the divisions of Arianism. In the strength
of orthodoxy they drove the Goths before
them on the field of Vougl&eacute; (507),
and brought
the green standard of the Prophet to a halt upon the
Loire (732).
The Franks were no better than
their neighbours&mdash;rather worse&mdash;so that it
was nothing but their orthodoxy which won for them
the prize which the Lombard and the Goth had missed,
and brought them through a long career of victory to
that proud day of universal reconciliation (800)
when the strife of ages was forgotten, and
Arianism with it&mdash;when, after more than three hundred
years of desolating anarchy, the Latin and the Teuton
joined to vindicate for Old Rome her just inheritance
of empire, and to set its holy diadem upon the head
of Karl the Frank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusion.</div>

<p>Now that we have traced the history of Arianism
to its final overthrow, let us once more glance at
the causes of its failure. Arianism, then,
was an illogical compromise. It went too
far for heathenism, not far enough for Christianity.
It conceded Christian worship to the Lord, yet made
him no better than a heathen demigod. It confessed
a Heavenly Father, as in Christian duty
bound, yet identified Him with the mysterious and
inaccessible Supreme of the philosophers. As a
scheme of Christianity, it was overmatched at every
point by the Nicene doctrine; as a concession to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
heathenism, it was outbid by the growing worship of
saints and relics. Debasing as was the error of
turning saints into demigods, it seems to have shocked
Christian feeling less than the Arian audacity which
degraded the Lord of saints to the level of his creatures.
But the crowning weakness of Arianism was the incurable
badness of its method. Whatever were the
errors of Athanasius&mdash;and in details they were not a
few&mdash;his work was without doubt a faithful search for
truth by every means attainable to him. He may be
misled by his ignorance of Hebrew or by the defective
exegesis of his time; but his eyes are always open to
the truth, from whatever quarter it may come to him.
In breadth of view as well as grasp of doctrine, he is
beyond comparison with the rabble of controversialists
who cursed or still invoke his name. The gospel was
truth and life to him, not a mere subject for strife and
debate. It was far otherwise with the Arians. On
one side their doctrine was a mass of presumptuous
theorizing, supported by alternate scraps of obsolete
traditionalism and uncritical text-mongering; on the
other it was a lifeless system of spiritual pride and
hard unlovingness. Therefore Arianism perished. So
too every system, whether of science or theology, must
likewise perish which presumes like Arianism to discover
in the feeble brain of man a law to circumscribe
the revelation of our Father's love in Christ.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
